\song{Crumbling Castle}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Meet me glassy-eyed, blind, and divine \\
Holding down the fort on the coastline. \\
The castle is a pimple oOn the face of our orb. \\
A humble spot for clues to drop iIf you eavesdrop. \\

I see through the bricks to the sea. (Crumbling castle.) \\
Water's rising up, thick and green. (Crumbling castle.) \\
Inching closer each century. (Crumbling castle.) \\
Are we safe in our \word{citadel}? \\

Look upon our condition. (Crumbling castle.) \\
You would not believe where I'm from. (Crumbling castle.) \\

We wait for the \word{death} that does not come. (Crumbling castle.) \\
Dug all the holes in \word[god]{God's} Acre. (Crumbling castle.) \\
We have even said our last rites. (Crumbling castle.) \\

Are we safe in our holding cell? \\
Look upon our condition. (Crumbling castle.) \\
We head to our extinction. (Crumbling castle.) \\

The sounds of the constant lightning \\
Would be enough to block out \\
The thought of the end of the world, \\
If it weren't for our tinnitus from the bomb. \\

In the wind I sway back and forth. \\
I'm brittle as an aged \word{human} being. \\
There my walls are safe from wild weather. \\
The filth forms into great nastiness. \\
Polygondwanaland. \\

I don't want to be \\
A crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle… \\

I don't want to fall into dust. \\
I don't want nothing but to live on. \\
The ache inside my keep spurs me on. \\
I don't want to be invisible. \\
Polygondwanaland. \\

I don't want to be \\
A crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle… \\

On this very day in one thousand years \\
The \word{Earth} will be relative \\
To the \word{Sun} and the \word{Moon} \\
And a new world will be created. \\
I know because it is written here. \\

I see through the bricks to the sea. (Crumbling castle.) \\
Inching closer each century. (Crumbling castle.) \\
Water's rising up, thick and green. (Crumbling castle.) \\

Are we safe in our citadel? \\
Look upon our condition. (Crumbling castle.) \\
You would not believe where I'm from. (Crumbling castle.) \\

I don't want to be \\
A crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle… \\

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Goodbye kinsman. (Polygon.) \\
I'm goin' abroad. (Gondwana.) \\
Drift until I. (Polygon.) \\
Get to my stop. (Gondwanaland.) \\

Grand and never been seen by man, \\
Veil of a \word{dream}. \\

We're gonna get there, we don't need a whereabouts. \\
We're gonna get there, follow where the \word{river} runs. \\
We're gonna get there, Polygondwanaland. \\

Exit snow melts. (Polygon.) \\
Float on rain drops. (Gondwana.) \\
It will get hot. (Polygon.) \\
Fasten seatbelts. (Gondwanaland.) \\

Sand and mountains \\
Unbosom its hidden hand. \\

We're gonna get there, we don't need no whereabouts. \\
We're gonna get there, follow where the river runs. \\
We're gonna get there, Polygondwanaland. \\

Polygondwanaland. \\
Can I see the eye that sees me? \\
Please show me these. \\

We're gonna get there, we don't need a whereabouts. \\
We're gonna get there, follow where the river runs. \\
We're gonna get there, Polygondwanaland. \\

\song{The Castle in the Air}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Narrator (Leah Senior)}

The \word{river} opened her mouth and spat into a vast sea, \\
Larger and bluer than a cloudless \word{sky}. \\
Muscular, prodigious, immortal. \\
But our \word{vessel} was invulnerable. \\

It was well built. \\
The boat rocked me into sleep \\
And I floated through a deep \word{dream}. \\
Smooth sailing through the castle in the air. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

One-eyed people living peaceful \\
With monopods and astomi. \\
Without malice or guile, \\
Without covetousness. \\

And there's men whose heads \\
Do grow beneath their shoulders. \\
Maybe we'll find the world's center \\
Where equinox casts no shadow. \\

Spread our teaching. \\
Alleviate their damnation. \\
Without us they'll go to \word{Hell}. \\
We are casting spells. \\

Could it be faithful? \\
Couldn't seem more real. \\
As I opened my eyes, \\
The dream decolourized until it was obscured \\
And the harsh reality hit me like salty water. \\

\song{Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Deserted dunes welcome weary feet. \\
Feel euphoric (Polygondwanaland.) \\
And so novel. (Polygondwanaland.) \\
Prehistoric, (Polygondwanaland.) \\
Living fossil. (Polygondwanaland.) \\

It's full of dinosaurs. \\

Nervous natives watch pompous pilgrims. \\
Foreign nature, (Polygondwanaland.) \\
Eerie jungle. (Polygondwanaland.) \\
Our bodies are (Polygondwanaland.) \\
Tasty morsels. (Polygondwanaland.) \\

It's full of dinosaurs. \\

\song{Inner Cell}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Meet with me, in the dark \\
Off the street, there we'll start. \\
Believing secretly, utopia. \\
Freedom in the inner cell. \\

Look for me with a beak. \\
A cloak adorned, scented leaves. \\
A void between fouler stench \\
Of those above whispering. \\
Inner cell. \\

Dance of the dead \\
Will descend on his head. \\
And extend \\
To the family's hubris. \\

From under the skin, insurrection. \\
From hollow logs, from shallow streams \\
And drying seas. \\

Let us walk through the night \\
To a place, clandestine. \\
Free your mind, disregard \\
All you know. \\
Infiltrate the inner cell. \\

You must not accept \\
His sick version of \word{life} itself. \\
Disrespect everything. \\
Multiply. \\
Inner cell. \\

Dance of the dead \\
Will descend on his head. \\
And extend \\
To the family's hubris. \\

From under the skin the flesh has rotten. \\
Poison has spread through words unsaid. \\
Anaemic rule. \\

Now hear me say: \\
``Our time has come.'' \\
Transcending us \\
Above the one. \\
To ego \word{death}. \\

For now he sits \\
Inside the fire. \\
Oblivious \\
That we will keep \\
Him in the spire. \\

Have found resolve \\
And our own crimes \\
To commit \\
In cold blood \\
As he did his. \\

\song{Loyalty}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I see all there is and has ever been. \\
I am not a man, I am everything. \\
Picture of purity. \\

Deific reign ordained unto me. \\
Prehistoric \word{God}, theophany. \\
I shall not be moved. \\
Those who try, I will drink their blood. \\

I'll be watching them, I am everywhere. \\
Floating on the wind, hiding in the dark. \\
Pure omniscience. \\
Traitors will all quake at the thought of me. \\
Hang them on a hook, put them on display. \\
Examples must be made. \\

This is a test, I am Lord. \\
Fear my wrath. \\
This is a test, I am Lord. \\
I am \word{death}. \\

What is with these crimes of treason? \\
I will fight this inquisition if I have to. \\
I will not surrender if I'm backed into a corner. \\
I will draw and quarter all their children. \\
Just to prove I'm not a coward. \\
I will put them all on the \word{Judas} Cradle \\
Just to show them a God incarnate. \\

Where's the loyalty? \\
Where's their loyalty? \\
Where's the loyalty? \\
Where's their loyalty? \\
No man, no problem. \\

\song{Horology}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Once upon a time \\
There was a great hermit dominion, \\
Veiled from inside and out. \\
Ruled by a lone eremite, \\
Bringer of an inferno. \\
Conduit to \word{Satan} himself, \\
To \word{Tchort}, \word{Abaddon}, and \word{Set}. \\
A demented figurehead. \\

Heinous looking thing, he was. \\
Cold and terrible, \\
A long and aquiline nose \\
Between swollen temples. \\
His green eyes a window \\
To the ninth circle of \word{Hell}. \\
A tiny neck supporting a head \\
Filled with an unbending desolation. \\

Seditious bands storm the bastion, \\
Alive with revenge. \\
Grand intentions. \\
Unbeknownst protomartyrs. \\
Indoctrinated with impalement. \\

Just like that, the plot was crushed, \\
Brushed away without a thought. \\
Some were found alive, though, \\
Left to run without their skin. \\
Cauterized and blistering, \\
Forever marked for all to see. \\
Reminding those who think dissent \\
Is a bridge across the sea. \\

One did make a pilgrimage \\
In search of a family. \\
Evaporated in the dark, \\
Stolen by the despot. \\
A journey made all the worse. \\
Having had his eyes gouged. \\
Left without the gift of sight \\
To face his true destroyer. \\

Across the land he walked with \word{death}, \\
Parading his ossuary. \\
Upon reaching the castle walls \\
A twist of fate, his mind baulks. \\

``Sit down weary traveler. \\
I am that which you seek. \\
Join me in a meal \\
To hear of my repentance. \\
Lift the veil from your eyes \\
And look beyond the three. \\
Now you know the truth behind: \\
It's tetrachromacy.'' \\

\song{Tetrachromacy}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I heard a story, could be true, \\
About a colour under blue. \\
You couldn't see it with your eyes \\
Or invent with intellect. \\

Like the inverse of colourblindness, \\
It's shrouded like a natural gas. \\
I gotta see it for myself, \\
Settle my own curiousness. \\

Back and forth, swing like the tide, \\
I look to left and to right. \\
My three shades are divisible. \\
Lust to see the invisible. \\

The story man was glassy-eyed, \\
He told me about the power lines. \\
And in subarctic caribou eyes \\
The metal wires burst into \word{life}. \\

They flick across the territory, \\
Resplendent like the \word{sky}. \\
Some of the snow absorbs UV, \\
Unseeable crumbs in dye. \\

Picking up clues by my mind's eye, \\
Scrutinize the iris of the storm's eye. \\
My three shades are divisible. \\
Lust to see the invisible. \\

Tetrachromacy. \\
See what I can't see. \\
Tetrachromacy. \\
See what I can't see. \\

Polygondwanaland. \\

Inconspicuous hue will be \\
Crowded camouflage to me. \\
My three shades are divisible. \\
Lust to see the invisible. \\

Tetrachromacy. \\
See what I can't see. \\
Tetrachromacy. \\
See what I can't see. \\

\song[Searching...]{Searching…}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Searching for the way, \\
Try to brighten up my day. \\
Searching for the gold \\
Inside the rainbow. \\
Looking through rose-coloured glasses won't work. \\
It won't change anything. \\

My body's not a temple, it is a \word{vessel} \\
And a blank slate. \\
An empty hard drive. \\
Doctor please, I'll do anything. \\
\word{Alter me}. \\
Let me see. \\
Give me more. \\
I want to see the world differently. \\

Searching, searching… \\

I've been born again, \\
I see the light. \\
It's in my face. \\
I'm analyzing information. \\
Now I am a \word{God}. \\

\song{The Fourth Colour}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I believe the hyperbole. \\
I see the fourth colour. \\

Rising up out of my body, \\
I am omnipresent for thee. \\
Many fingers, many minds and \\
Many eyeballs puppet my feet. \\
I walk the streets holy. \\

I've been born again. \\
I see the light. \\
It's in my face. \\
My brain is storing information. \\
Now I'm a \word{God} in a \word{photon}. \\

I see through walls. \\
I see your heat. \\
I can see your terror. \\
With sight you can see the future. \\

I believe the hyperbole. \\
I see the fourth colour. \\
I can see tetrachromacy. \\
I see the fourth colour. \\

Rising up out of my body, \\
I am omnipresent for thee. \\
Many fingers, many minds and \\
Many eyeballs puppet my feet. \\
I walk the streets holy. \\
Supreme and see all that has been. \\

All that will be. \\
Third eye is free. \\
I am nobody. \\
Tetrachromacy. \\

I believe the hyperbole. \\
I see the fourth colour. \\

I've been born again. \\
I see the light. \\
It's in my face. \\
I'm analyzing information. \\
Now I am a God. \\
