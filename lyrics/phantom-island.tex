\song{Phantom Island}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I just woke up from a \word{dream}. \\
I was in a place I'd never been, or never seen. \\
So I packed up my horse, everything seemed sweet. \\
Found the closest speakeasy and ordered a stiff drink. \\

Fuck, I never thought I'd lose my mind. \\
I s'ppose sanity is easy to lose and hard to find. \\
Hey, and can you hear that tintinnabulation? \\
Are all the bats in the belfry again? \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

A landborn illusion breaks the \word[ocean]{ocean's} surface. \\
Is this mental confusion or have I \\
Finally found my purpose? \\
Coconut congas playing in time \\
With the waltz of a tortoise. \\
A symphony of delusion as my thoughts \\
Finally realize their purpose. \\

I hope this place is here in the morning. \\
Or I'll be floating back to the land \\
With the water bloated corpses. \\
That palm tree's looking at me funny \\
With a sideways belligerence. \\
A symphony of delusion as my thoughts \\
Realize their ignorance. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Paranoia's umbra grows. \\
Is that laughter or a crow? \\
Every rustle in the trees a potential snare. \\
Close my eyes and block my ears. \\
Cut the \word{cord} and leave me here. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Phantom. (Phantom.) \\
Island. (Island.) \\
Phantom. (Phantom.) \\
Yeah! \\
Island. (Island.) \\
Woo! \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Am I chasin' shadows? \\
Reality superimposed. \\
Every footprint in the sand. \\
Every crackle of dry leaves. \\
Every wave that breaks too close. \\
Every whisper on the breeze. \\
Every shape inside a cloud. \\
Every star that's out of place. \\
Everything that I believe. \\
Throw it all into the sea and be free. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Sixteen horses galloping. \\
Twelve long years of grabbing. \\
Grappling the bull by its horns. \\
I can feel it in my loins. \\
The crippling \word{Moon} wash cycle. \\
The laughing \word{river}, rising flood. \\
The flip of the coin. \\
It's another turning point. \\

Phantom island, insane asylum. (Phantom.) \\
Phantom island, insane asylum. (Phantom.) \\
I'm the drover, cattle dog. \\
The lame and laggard, one true \word{God}. \\

Let your bygones be bygones. \\
Bow down to \word{Set} and \word{Typhon}. \\
The long lagoon of rhythmic hooves. \\
Bound and stampede running through the \\

Phantom island, insane asylum. (Phantom.) \\
Phantom island, insane asylum. (Phantom.) \\
Phantom island, insane asylum. (Phantom.) \\
Chanting sirens ringing clear. \\

The palm trees' heads are banging. \\
Stuck inside a mental siege. \\
Godspeed, the shore cliff hanging. (Phantom.) \\
We must retreat back to sea. (Phantom.) \\
(Woo!) \\

\song{Deadstick}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

There once flew a pilot, high and free. \\
Danced with the clouds. \\
Pirouetted with the breeze. \\
But out of synch to the mechanical beat \\
That pulsed at the heart of the metal machine. \\

Thought of their partner \\
And thought of their kids. \\
Thought where they're going \\
And thought where they've been. \\
But a subtle change. \\
The routine shattered. \\
Prepare the mind. \\
Arrange the matters. \\

\word{Deadstick}. (Deadstick.) \\
Deadstick. (Deadstick.) \\
I'm a bird with a broken wing. \\
Deadstick. (Deadstick.) \\
Deadstick. (Deadstick.) \\
This nightingale can't sing. \\
Yeah! \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

I wake with a retch to the smell of ammonia. \\
And my eyes start watering. \\
A shadow? A body? \\
``Who are you?'' I say, \\
When a voice cracks like a frozen lake. \\
``I am your child.'' \\
You are my \word{mother}, and I'm sitting here dying.'' \\
I say, ``I got no children. \\
I am but a boy, you are mistaken.'' \\

She sings: \\
``Follow me down \\
Through the wind and the \word{Earth}. \\
To the edge of the forgotten seas.'' \\
``Save me from the hurt. \\
Tell me of my worth.'' \\
A phantom is taking everything.'' \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Deadstick. \word{Death} wish. \\
Panic in the cockpit. \\
Praying in the cabin. \\
We're all holding hands. \\
Deadstick. Death wish. \\
Lost all propulsive. \\
Propellers ain't spinning. \\
Being forced to land. \\

Deadstick. Death wish. \\
We're shutting off the engines. \\
Blue skies are turning a darker grey. \\
Deadstick. Death wish. \\
Heading for the smoking hole \\
In the airfield I can't locate. \\

Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Save me! \\
I'm in a tight spot. \\
Catastrophe. \\
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Save me! \\
I'm 'bout to make a crash landing. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Deadstick. Deadstick. \\
I'm a bird with a broken wing. \\
Deadstick. (Deadstick.) \\
Deadstick. (Deadstick.) \\
This nightingale can't sing. \\
Yeah! \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Deadstick. Death wish. \\
I can't believe we made it out alive. \\
Deadstick. Death wish. \\
Send me help before I \word{die}. \\

\song{Lonely Cosmos}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

From the belly of the jungle where I launched, \\
I fly through time as dead as it is cold. \\
I miss my home. \\
Lonely \word{cosmos}. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Fading in the solar. \\
Space \word{dream} floating. \\
I've been getting older. \\
Satellite burning. \\
Galaxy shattering. \\

Bathin' in the cola. (Bathing, bathing.) \\
Black Sea boating. (Boating, boating.) \\
Alien freeloader. (Loader, loader.) \\
Are we alone in this cosmic effigy? \\

Splitting timber before the axe hits. \\
Snowball rolling avalanches. \\
Roses for the prophet. \\
In the haze, a swirling mystic appears \\
With a sunburnt kiss. \\
Quick sand, sunken ships. \\
Are we alone in the cosmic abyss? \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

I'm inhaling stardust. \\
Don't leave me floating. \\
This is not how I would want to \word{die}. \\
I'm sitting on \word[saturn]{Saturn's} rings. \\

Don't leave me yet. \\
This isn't how I would want to die. \\
Orbiting is lonely until you comprehend: \\
We're only stardust. \\
I'm the furthest I've ever been from home. \\
Contemplating that every meteorite \\
Is my tombstone. \\

Lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, \\
Lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lonely cosmos. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I sent Ma and Pa some mail. \\
Will take 620 years to travel. \\
I said, ``I've seen beyond the ridge, \\
From \word{Milky Way} and to the edge.'' \\
But I still miss my home. \\
Lonely cosmos. \\

\song{Eternal Return}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

This old dog's coming home to you. \\
Always return. \\
I'm on a round trip perpetual. \\
Always revolving. \\
It's habitual. \\
Eternal return, eternal return. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

It was a heavy dawn, this morn'. \\
The raining \word{sky} even mourned. \\
Your eyes, usually full of \word{life}, \\
Hiding tears not yet cried. \\
That smile from my child \\
As I waved a brave goodbye. \\
Drippin' wet, I \word{dream} of future memories. \\
A life unfolds in front of me. \\

I worry which reality (reality) she would see. \\
Did I do it for her, or did I do it for me? \\
As I compose myself emotionally, \\
I have a vision of where she will be. \\
Pulling petals off a daisy. \\
Just don't forget I return eternally. \\

\vocalsby{Lucas Harwood \& Cook Craig}

Eternal. (Eternal.) \\
(Return.) Return. \\
Always. (Always.) \\
On wing (On wing.) \\
Flying. (Flying.) \\
Eternal return. \\
Eternal return. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Although I'm in \word{love} with the long road. (Long road.) \\
Running from my limping shadow back home. (Back home.) \\
Sharp green leaves of laurel \\
Turn to gold in the Oregon fall. \\
Crimson rust, rising tide. \\
Sparkles in the Californian sun. \\
But I must admit, \\
I miss the sweet smell of gum leaves. \\
And the unpredictable. \\
Ever-changing, ever-seasonally. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

We had our life on lock, oh yes we did. (Yes we did.) \\
There's more to it now than just leaving. \\
'Cause there's so much more to miss. \\
But now that you're here, \\
It's harder and less clear. \\
But I guess distance needs a yardstick \\
For real love to hit. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

Which way is the right way down \\
The \word{yellow brick road} of life? (Life.) \\
I'm tossing and turning between my time \\
With a scarecrow and my tin man wife. (Wife.) \\
There's a monkey on my back and \\
He's telling me this ain't a bushwhack. (Whack.) \\
Everywhere looks the same when \\
You're looking through a magnifying glass \\
In a small man's world. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

But as your face is changing, I have to turn my back. \\
Please don't judge me for the sacrifice I make. \\
Fuck, I miss the smell hidden in your clothing. \\
I tell myself: ``Don't worry. \\
Because I'll be coming back.'' \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Joey Walker}

Do do do… \\
(This old dog's coming home to you.) \\
Do do do… (Bow bow bow…). \\
(Always return, I'm on a round trip perpetual.) \\
Do do do… (Bow bow bow…). \\

\song{Panpsych}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Can you feel the weight \\
Of the \word{Earth} on your shoulders? \\
Are you always sailing through troubled waters? \\
And born under a cloud? \\
The earth, the sea, the \word{sky}. \\
One roof, one house. \\

What will be, will be. \\
Find your zen, embrace the journey. (Panpsych in hand.) \\
In every grain of sand \\
Holds a mind which can expand \\
From now until the next big bang. \\

One is all and all is one. \\
A spirit in every form. (Spirit.) \\
Thou art that and that art thou. \\
All panpsych. (Panpsych, panpsych, panpsych.) \\
The wind whispers a secret message \\
For those who've grown ears to hear it. (Hear it.) \\

You're inside it. \\
Be within it. \\
Panpsych. (Panpsych.) \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Slurp the sweet divine of the pearl oyster. \\
Wonderer's amulet for the latte pastures. \\
Next stop unknown to the primitive cockroach. \\
We are omnipresent. \\
Intertwined horoscope. \\

I am trying to pick a path. \\
Past the psychic wind. \\
Past the astral dreadnought. \\
I am flying straight through the stars. \\
Gimme that \word{life}-giving linkage \\
To my higher self with a pure heart. \\

\vocalsby{Lucas Harwood}

I, I am the wind and sea. \\
I am that stabbing pain. \\
Creeping in your higher mind. \\
Beaming in your astral plane. \\
I am the bright red blood crossing \\
Through your little veins. \\
I am the thought your arm has \\
'Fore your mind can catch it feign. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

You've been bathing within me for some time. \\
Between the wave and foam, I have been the tide. \\
Unending delusion ad infinitum. \\
But there's always exhalation. \\
The \word[dog on freeway]{dog on the freeway} thinks it's in control. \\
It's testosterone that makes a man think he's strong. \\
Unending delusion ad infinitum. \\
But there's always exhalation. \\

You're inside it. \\
Be within it. \\
It's creeping higher. \\
Exhalation. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

It's coming down to the wire. \\
This plane's on fire. \\
It's you. \\
It's us. \\
Ride the magic bus. \\
Crash land in the sand. \\
We'll do it hand in hand. \\

\song{Spacesick}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Spacesick on my spaceship… \\

June 22. \\
What I wouldn't do for a meal with you. \\
Real fork, real \word{knife}, in a shit diner. \\
The sound of metal on china. \\
Remember when we rode the 'coaster? \\
Remember when we sailed the strait? \\
You think they could've worked out the drugs up here. \\
'Cause it's like that, but floating in space. \\

\word[earth]{Earth-rise} doesn't hit quite the same \\
When you've been spun merry-go-round all day. \\
\word{God}, I miss that grounding feeling. \\
Grass on bare toes, gravity, healing. \\
Anyway, enough about me. \\
How did the little ones sleep? \\
Did you make it to the zoo? \\
Fuck, I miss 'em, and you. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

I've been \word{dreaming} in a virtual lab. \\
When I stood up in class and said \\
I wanted to be an astronaut, they laughed. \\
T-Minus ten minutes and counting down. \\
Four, three, two, one. \\
We have lift-off. \\
We're heading out. \\
That's when it turned south. \\

The nausea's familiar, \\
But I can't put my finger on it. \\
Never quite felt like this before. \\
But it's nothing out of the norm. \\
Vestibular euphoria. \\
I'm floating like a seesaw feather. \\
The constellations settle the spacesickness. \\
Putting me back together. \\

Moaning and groaning. \\
Rolling side to side. \\
The parasites are building a city on my intestines. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

I see you. \\
Swaddled by the solidity \\
Of terrestrial fabric. \\
Entangled in it's loam. \\

I see you. \\
I pull you taut and you dissolve \\
Between white-knuckled fists. \\
Like a hand full of sand. \\
Reclaimed by gravity. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

June 22, continued. \\
I lost ya there, must've been a solar flare. \\
Where was I? \\
Yeah, zoo. \\
Thinking 'bout them and thinking 'bout you. \\
Since your brother told me they cried a lot \\
When they saw a guy who looked like their pop. \\

Oh yeah, and that meal. \\
To fuss about who pays the bill. \\
To sit on chairs that touch the floor. \\
For that, I'd give it all. \\
'Til then, \word{dream} is all I can do. \\
I love you. \\
Over. \\
Stu. \\

Spacesick on my spaceship… \\

\song{Aerodynamic}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

A doorway opened. \\
Endless \word{ocean}. \\
Super highway. \\
Scoundrels unbind. \\
The ship was gently swaying, cradled. \\
Smooth sailing in a wintery July. \\
The silence of the lifeless \word{soul}. \\
Shimmers in the early morning glow. \\
Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy. \\
The thunder's knock, knock, knocking. \\
\word[devil]{Devil's} staring back at me, yeah. \\

Lightning strikes upon the nose of my boat. \\
As I'm shapeshifting and drifting. \\
Trying to stay afloat. \\
Crystal clear. \\
I've got a vision of a deer in the headlights. \\
The end is near. \\
Without a fear in sight. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

The \word{Moon} speaks to me this night. (Yeah!) \\
She says: ``Follow my light.'' \\
Like a moth's inner compass.'' \\
She says: ``Chase what you can't have.'' \\
This land-borne curse clings to you like algae.'' \\
If only you were a star, you'd be not sedentary.'' \\

I said, ``I have always wondered \\
If I could step out of my body. \\
Would I be a fish out of water? \\
Or like a school in harmony?'' \\
``So miss Moon, if I could have one wish, \\
I'd turn my hands into wings. \\
I'd say goodbye to the fish \\
And jump from the highest cliff.'' \\
Yeah. \\

I wanna be aerodynamic. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Never gonna get there. Never gonna get there. \\
Holy land is a figment. \\
Never gonna get there. Never gonna get there. \\
Sailing for infinity. \\
Never gonna get there. Never gonna get there. \\
Holy land is a figment. \\
Never gonna get there. Never gonna get there. \\
This ship is a shipwreck. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

I'm just floating away \\
On this barrel of paint. \\
Is this just me stranded at sea \\
In a sailor's \word{dream}? \\
I'll just sing to the sharks, \\
And maybe they'll think twice. \\

They're just trying to survive \\
In the world like me, alright. \\
I ain't got hope but I can't help but smile. \\
The forty-odd thousand foot of tears \\
Won't save me from an appetite. \\
I accept my fate, my time is nigh. \\
I'm just gonna sit here \\
And watch the waves roll by. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I wanna be aerodynamic. \\

\song{Sea of Doubt}

\writtenby{Cavanagh/Craig/Harwood/Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Michael Cavanaugh}

One, two, three, four. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I'm on the edge of a cliff. \\
Gazing into an abyss. \\
Weight of it all crushes me, a landslide of anxiety. \\
I'm in the forest of my mind, adrift in moonless night. \\
Where is the map for the journey? \\
Where are the crewmates who join me? \\
Born adrift, a fickle route. \\
I'm in a \word{sea of doubt}. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

Not again, not again, not again, not again, not again. \\
Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? \\

I'm sinking deeper. \\
Submerging in the sea of doubt. \\
Gotta tread water \\
Until I reach the shore and find my way out. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

We scatter the ashes from the singing birds' urn. \\
Lingers in the air, then it settles into the earth. \\
There's a light at the end of the tunnel. \\
It may appear soft and subtle. \\
And when you're trying to push uphill, \\
The world tends to make you kneel. \\
It's a harsh and feeble game. \\
Your heart was full and then it sank. \\
Breath bubbles to the surface. \\
My anchor closed the curtains. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Here comes the \word{Sun} to clear the fog. \\
Here comes a friend for me to lean on. \\
Through the swell, and through the cloud. \\
We're gonna swim out of the sea of doubt. \\

We stand on solid ground. \\
We take the time to look around. \\
The lightness of the air lifts me. \\
A breeze of serenity. \\
We're in the meadow of our minds. \\
Basking in it's delight. \\

Woo! \\
Yeah, yeah, yeah… \\
And to my loved ones, \\
Who navigate the current of \word{life}. \\
And who, occasionally or regularly, \\
Feel rudderless in the \word{river}: \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

In this long night, there is no end. \\
Deep dominion. \\
\word{Father}, be my friend. \\
I stand on the shoulders of \word[mother]{mothers} long dead. \\
Singing their stories. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Life is but an eddy. \\
So be a leaf in a stream. \\
Eternally we return to cycle \\
Through the song we learnt. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

I would say, ``Don't be a musician, my son. \\
Be a doctor, lawyer, or a stand-up citizen.'' \\
People on the street would stop and ask me if I'm proud. \\
But I'm not proud. \\
``You did it yoursef, I wasn't around.'' \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

But time is pregnant with the past. \\
With the knowledge that they lost. \\
Time is eating its last meal. \\
If they listened, could they heal? \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Yeah, yeah, yeah… \\
And though I cannot hold you, \\
You will know my presence by virtue of the wind. \\
You know your daddy never knew what he was doing. \\
It's all \word{love}. \\
I love you. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

I am wind. \\
I am rain. \\
I am \word{photon}. \\
I am wave. \\
I am wind. \\
I am rain. \\
I am photon. \\
I am wave. \\
I am love, trauma, pain. \\
Reincarnate hurricane. \\
I have sinned. \\
Fanned the flames. \\
Knocking on the pearly gates. \\

Bye bye \word{Shanghai}. \\
Bye bye Shanghai. \\
Bye bye Shanghai. \\
Grow wings and fly. \\
Let's get real high. \\
Let's get real high. \\
Let's get real high. \\
Transcend this life. \\

I wanna drink from the beehive. \\
I wanna jump from the tightwire. \\
Like a moth into a fire. \\
I'm gonna burn up on the pyre. \\
Well, it's \word{love} at first sight. \\
\word[moon]{Moonstruck} on this night. \\
Sing a \word{swan song} on the lyre \\
And fly away one last time. \\
Yeah. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

When I first saw you, \\
Lying there in wait \\
With your unearthed buried smile. \\
I sing to my duckling: \\
``Yes, you must learn to use your wings. \\
But it is I that will be taught by you to fly.'' \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The distorted view from my misty window \\
Has a thin ray of light that's got a peaking crescendo. \\
The \word{Moon} is a clock face that's tick, tick, ticking \\
With a crooked smile. \\
We're all in the \word{rat race}. \\
Together we go the extra mile. \\

Knock the surrounding buildings down. \\
I'm calling out for help. \\
I'm shedding my skin like a \word{snake} slithering. \\
You gotta stop the overwhelming self doubt. \\
Catch me dancing in the summer rain \\
With my tongue out. \\
Yeah! \\
