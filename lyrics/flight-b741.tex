\song{Mirage City}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

There's a place I wanna go \\
'Cause my ma and pa, they fight at home. \\
And though my feet may never grace the sand, \\
It helps to give me hope. \\
Where the waters flow superluminally \\
And where tachyons light \word{heavenly}. \\
Where \word{Chang'e} plays her superstrings, \\
They call it M.C. \\

What would it mean to be a beam travelling like lightning? \\
Across cosmic ravine and to the city I have seen. \\
In the nazar of my eye, the skyline, \\
At once dead and alive. \\
To see that picture in my mind, \\
Pull focus on the lens of time. \\

Waves crashing down like a lion pride roar. \\
Beyond the break a heavenly haven shimmers in the open water. \\
The fortune teller never predicted this in her crystal ball. \\
Is that a city drifting from afar or a reflection mirage? \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

In the mirror ripples I get lost, \\
Wondering 'bout my ma and pa and the little town where I'm from. \\
If only I could swim or sail across \\
To the \word{Mirage City} where my prayers are answered by the Lord. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

I can't wait to leave this nightmare behind. \\
I see it so clearly now, you're springtime and I'm ice. \\
So I'll leave you with a message that I wrote. (It says:) \\
``Your shadow ain't burnt into my \word{soul} anymore.'' \\

So I follow the crow. (Blood on the road.) \\
And the prey of eagles. (Chained to my throat.) \\
I am suffering no more. \\
But it's just a mirage in the wind disappearing. \\

Yeah, so I build my own Chimera \\
And face up to it's hate. \\
I'm sick of being a scared little cunt \\
That sleeps through all my \word[dream]{dreams}. \\
I'm done with this city and the hurt it's caused. \\

Reflection on the back of my shirt. \\
I'm done treading water in the \word{sea of doubt}. \\
I ain't a backpacker caught in a rip, yeah. \\
I die if I stay here, reborn if I leave. \\
It's time for me to say goodbye to Mirage City. \\

One, two, three, four, fuckin'--

\song{Antarctica}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Take me away. (Take me away.) \\
I wanna feel them frost flakes on my face again. (Woo!) \\
Take me away. (Take me away.) \\
Where the temperature stays below 25/78. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

I felt so at home down here, \\
Had to step out of the heat. \\
\word{Antarctica} that's the place, \\
Synthetic breeze on my face. \\
I'm a polar bear in denial, \\
I can't help but hate the heat. \\
(I can't help but hate the heat.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

It's gonna be a miss, I can tell, \\
We've got snowball's chance in \word{Hell}. \\
I know this ain't gonna go well, \\
Snowball's chance in Hell. \\
It's gonna be a miss, I can tell, \\
We've got snowball's chance in Hell. \\
I know this ain't gonna go well, \\
Snowball's chance in Hell. \\

I made a deal with the devil in the fuselage, \\
Crashed into \word{heaven} in the dead of winter. \\
Walked on thin ice and got snowed under, \\
Caught my \word{death} and got iced over. \\
Got cold feet and a cold shoulder, \\
Ice in my veins and frost in my heart. \\
The cold hard truth is, I'm the polar opposite. \\
Carved a hole in heaven like an icebreaker. \\

\vocalsby{Lucas Harwood}

Fahrenheit or Celsius, \\
Tell me what your policy is. \\
Are we talking the same language? \\
It won't matter in utopia. (Utopia.) \\
Antarctica is the place for the cold embrace. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

(Take me away, take me away.) \\
Antarctica, that's the place for me. \\
(Take me away, take me away.) \\
It's the place where the frost flakes spell out my name. \\
(Take me away, take me away.) \\
There's a polar bear calling out my name. \\
(take me away, take me away.) \\
He's telling me that a sunny day ain't got shit on this place. \\
(Woo!)

Take me away, take me away… \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

When you got it made. (When you got it made.) \\
When you got it made. (When you got it made.) \\
It's just the tip of the iceberg. (It's just the tip of the iceberg.) \\
It's just the tip of the iceberg so put it on ice. (You gotta put it on…) \\
You gotta put it on ice. (You gotta put it on…) \\
You gotta put it on ice in our discontented winter, \\
And let that cool air blow away your every care. \\

\song{Raw Feel}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

How does it feel. \\
To you when you're circling the drain? \\
Is it for real? \\
Can you ever know you're feeling pain? \\
Because experience is different for everyone. \\
One thing for me might be three for some, \\
And you can never know this, but you think you do. \\
The same shit for me ain't the same shit for you. \\

What does the sunlight feel like on your skin? \\
Does it smell like the sound of a pill kickin' in? \\
Or the taste of a song that makes you want to scream? \\
Raw feels for you, feel raw to me. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Do your insides churn when you take a wrong turn? \\
Do you feel the hurt when you're bogged down in the dirt? \\
Do you keep on trucking when the lesson's learned? \\
And if you're feeling nothin', well, that's a concern. \\

\vocalsby{Lucas Harwood}

What I see is poles apart from your sunken eyes. \\
Your blue wall is green to me, why are you surprised? \\
I've always pondered feeling needle on my skin. \\
Is it pure bliss or complete chagrin? \\

Raw feel. (Raw feel.) \\
Raw feel. (Raw feel.) \\
Raw feel. (Raw feel.) \\
What's your achilles heel? \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

I'm breaking through. \\
This is a sensory moment I'm all about sharing with you. \\
I'm seeing things through the flesh. \\
This feeling's raw and it feels the best. \\
Peel my skin back, what do you see? \\
You and me, with a raw sensibility. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

We'll dig to \word{Hell} and back so you can see the \word[devil]{Devil's} lair. \\
We'll fly to \word{heaven} and home just to feel wind in your hair. \\
We'll climb the highest peak to smell an air of different kind. \\
We'll shoot an arrow through the \word{Sun} to see exploding skies \\
Into forgotten caves to taste an ancient wine, \\
And \word{dream} myself into the forest of your mind. \\

Can we ever know? \\
Does it matter if we don't? \\
Be at peace. \\
Be internal. \\
The gentle flow is tranquil. \\

Raw feel for you. \\
Raw feel for me. \\
Raw feel for everyone… \\

\song{Field of Vision}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Butterflies, they begin to flutter now. \\
Melting inside the popcorn butter brow. \\
The shots are lined up, gotta love that clinking sound. \\
Jess is cracking the whip to head down. \\

Am I an offering to the gods in the ring? \\
Entertaining feast fit for a king. \\
All the blood, sweat, and the tears that we put into everything. \\
Year after year, we're still here. \\

In this field of vision. (Field of vision.) \\
We seeing cylclopean. (Cyclopean.) \\
In this field of vision. (Field of vision.) \\
We don't need need no religion. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Still running blind after so many years. \\
Surely something's gotta give? \\
Corneal conditions got me scrutinizing. \\
I'm feeling like a horse on Ket. \\

Yeah, the thunder of the hooves, \\
Run from the pack of wolves. \\
The drumming of the limbs overtake the wind. \\
Living in a field of vision. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Big ride, leather-eyed, with a one-track mind. \\
One race, one course, fly upon the metal horse. \\
Goose for the sauce, get bruised, get loose, \\
Attitude, blindfold me. \\
I can see the music. \\

Look at me, (Field of vision.) \\
You and your orchid of eyes. (Cyclopean.) \\
Sight can sting. (Field of vision.) \\
I'm thinking that it's harvest time, yeah. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

I lied to \word{God}. \\
Faith dead, stage plot. \\
Bird strike at height. \\
I glide. \\

I'm being a silly. I'm being a silly billy… \\
Silly billy. Woo! \\

b741. \\

Well, I'm sweatin' \\
And I'm putting lipstick on. \\
Happy in mud. \\
I'm goin the whole hog. \\

When \word[pig]{pigs} fly, \\
I'll be on the flight. \\

Take my gift, it's made of mud. \\
A masterpiece, a work of art. (A masterpiece of art.) \\
I take not your coin, for I have no use. \\
I'm happy in my own refuse. (I'm happy in mud.) \\
But I'm in a poke. (I'm in a poke.) \\
I'm casting pearls before me. (I'm casting pearls.) \\
I'm on your back. (I made a silk purse.) \\
I made a silk purse from my ears. (From my ears.) \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Here, piggy piggy piggy! \\

Calling out my battle cry, \\
Tryna to find my partner in crime. \\
Tryna to woo the sow in the heat. \\
Oooh, pig, sooie. \\

I wanna wine and dine 'ya, I'm a feral swine. (Dine.) \\
That'd turn down miss piggy to make you mine. (Mine.) \\

When \word{Hell} freezes overm \\
When the fat lady sings 'til she's blue in the face. \\
What if the \word{rat} eats the king cobra? \\
Does that mean the turtles win the race? \\

When \word[pig]{pigs} fly, (When pigs fly.) \\
I'll be on the flight. (b741.) \\

We've come a long way from the sty in the farm sun. \\
I'll be flying high first class, with my piggy chumps. \\

When \word[pig]{pigs} fly, \\
I'll be on the flight. \\
b741. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

I've got sweat beading down my spine, \\
That's the feeling of a swines taking off. \\
This flight's gonna crash, \\
And then my hooves start to thrash \\
And then my teeth start to gnash \\
Until we hit the ground. \\

There ain't no mud in the \word{sky} \\
And I'm cruising on high altitude \\
On this flight. \\

\song{Le Risque}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Feel it, know it, \\
Trust in the lie you've been sold. \\
Oh yeah? No risk? \\
Tell yourself whatever you need to hear. \\
To fall just right, \\
Like a dagger from a height. \\
'Cause \word{death} to me, \\
Is a \word{life} lived safely. \\

Gimme something to thin the blood. \\
There's nothin' quite like diggin' graves for fun. \\
It gets my body ringing like a bell. \\
'Cause I'm the fuckin' recoil of a gun \\
In \word{Hell}. \\

\vocalsby{Michael Cavanaugh}

Ha ha ha ha ha, alright. \\
No heart. (No heart.) \\
No tick. (No tick.) \\
I'm weak as piss. \\
No risk. \\
No fire. (No fire.) \\
No flame. (No flame.) \\
I'm always feelin' the same. \\

The risk. (The risk.) \\
It sits. (It sits.) \\
At the tip of my tiny prick. \\
No style. (No style.) \\
No ease. (No ease.) \\
I'm a pathetic forgotten steaze. \\

Alright. The risk. \\
Let's ride. The risk. \\
Well, alright. The risk. \\
Oh, it's time. The risk. \\
Okay let's ride. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Hello, \word{Evil Knievel}, \\
Running through the red light. \\
Philippe Petit, yeah, \\
Walk the tightwire. \\
Take the risk, take the risk. \\
You only live once. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Where softer \word[soul]{souls} do sleep. \\
In the hush of morning's glow. \\
I rest not, I cannot. \\
I just go. \\

The risk, my muse, \\
For its focus I depend. \\
Nosedive into the ocean, \\
Do dangerous shit and transcend. \\
This world, (This world.) \\
It spins too slow. \\
Its tempo paints my world in grey. \\
My heart cannot beat fast enough. \\
The risk is technicolour paint. \\

One \word{life}, (One life.) \\
One chance. (One chance.) \\
Clench the moment in your hand. \\
Adrenaline, my dearest friend, \\
It's me and you until the end. \\

\song{Flight b741}

\vocalsby{Lucas Harwood}

Have you traveled far? \\
Pilgrim or a Wayfarer? \\
Hit yet the great expanse, \\
I long for that feel of romance. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

(Have you traveled far?) \\
Is this the place I want to be? (Far, far away.) \\
I've got to make this pilgrimage (Far, far, far.) \\
Throwing off these chains. (Up in the \word{sky}.) \\
I see across the sky where I need to be. \\

Well, picture me far away. \\
It's hard enough to say \\
That you'd given it all up and fly away. \\
There's a hundred million steps between \\
Here and where I'd wanna be. \\
Until I take the journey \\
There's no other place I think I'd rather be. \\

\vocalsby{Lucas Harwood}

Well, I've never traveled lonesome. \\
As the feeling goes, \\
This plane is going down with me on. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

The splatter of the engine and the creaking of the skeleton, \\
Composing a requiem, I'm frightened. \\
If only we were at sea level, sailing a waterborne \word{vessel}. \\
Memory, my only anchor, I love you. \\

In another \word{life}, I would have thought about it twice, \\
I would have taken your advice, I would have said ``I'm sorry.'' \\
If by some unlikely chance my plane miraculously lands, \\
I'll live every moment I can in gratitude. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Darlin', I, I'll do it for you \\
And do it again until the plane can't move. \\
I'll go back to school and learn to fly. \\
No plane can stop me from falling to you. \\
Baby I'll be seeing you from above the storm, \\
Through a cyclone's eye, your wings are mine. \\
They keep me gliding across auroras until I'm home. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

Have you traveled far? \\
Far, far away. (Far, far, far.) \\
Throwing off these chains. (Up in the sky.) \\
I see across the sky where I need to be. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

What if we fall out of the sky? \\
Is there even air to hold us? \\
How are we floating here? \\
This makes no sense. \\
I wanna go home. \\

\song{Sad Pilot}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

I've been to the doctor somewhat recently. (Because,) \\
I haven't felt safe in my skin. (Uh-uh.) \\
There's an army of torment policing my pain, \\
And it's got me disintegrating. \\

How will it manifest? (Manifest.) \\
And from what materials will it be made? (I don't know, I don't know.) \\
How long can one spend dying (Dying, before.) \\
Before they completely disappear? \\

Gotta leave my problems at the jet bridge. (Problems.) \\
Can't be carrying heavy luggage. \\
Gotta leave my problems at the jet bridge. (Problems.) \\
Can't be carrying heavy luggage. \\

Relationships, falling to pieces. \\
(No matter how much I keep on screaming.) \\
Treat 'em how you like to be treated. \\
Leave your problems at the door. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The turmoil is boilin' up, steaming hot. \\
Wish I never let it get to this point of no return. \\
Seems as though I've hit a roadblock. \\
My wheels ain't pulling up, they keep dragging down. \\

I've got a lot of fuel to burn. \\
I've been drinkin' (Drinkin', drinkin'.) \\
On the job. \\
Not much thinkin' going on \\
About the passengers I got on board. \\
\word[satan]{Satan's} winkin' (Winkin', winkin'.) \\
And giving me the nod. \\
My eyelids are twitching from my beer goggles \\
As I'm tryna clear the fog. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Gotta leave my problems at the jet bridge. \\
Can't be be carrying heavy luggage. \\
Gotta leave my problems at the jet bridge or you'll be sufferin' some heavy losses. \\
Psychologists, no, they ain't listenin' \\
No matter how much I keep on screamin' \\
Treat me like you treat the other ones if I'm to leave your problems at the door. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I'll just keep on winging it. (Wing it.) \\
There's always blue skies ahead. (Blue skies.) \\
I'll just keep on winging it. (Wing it.) \\
Gotta keep it all up in the air. \\
Put my chin up, (Chin up.) \\
Fly high. (Flying high.) \\
Zenith. (Zenith.) \\
Ascent. (Ascent.) \\

\song{Rats In The Sky}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

I'd rather be amongst the clouds, \\
Elevated, elevated in the \word{sky}. \\
Don't care too much, yeah, for the ground. \\
Elevated, rats in the sky. \\

Liquid gurgling coos. (Coos.) \\
My neck is bobbling like a bobblehead \\
From a high-rise city view apartment. \\
Rainbow oil puddle, greasy sheen. \\
Never been wild, never been that tame. \\
Internal compass paves the way. \\

I'd rather be amongst the clouds, \\
Elevated, elevated in the sky. \\
Don't care too much, yeah, for the ground. \\
Elevated, rats in the sky. \\

\vocalsby{Cook Craig}

I'm so goddamn filthy. (Filthy.) \\
Am I a pet or is this man trying to kill me? (Kill me.) \\
Take my little hood off and set me free, \\
So I can join the other feathered rats at the bar. \\
There's the garbage man with a scar on his heart. \\
Primordial reasons got me thinking that we're not so far apart. \\

Not so far. \\
Filth rats in the sky. \\
Not so far apart. \\
Sky borne rats don't lie. \\

I'm making a detour by the pub \\
To eat a little lunch and take a load off. \\
The garbage man knows we're a symbiotic duo. \\
Look out for that cat named Bruno. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bread crusts are my banquet, \\
Puddles are my wine. \\
I revel in the present, \\
Each moment, a lifetime. \\
I need only flap my wings \\
And I'm where I want to be. \\

This cruel city that I love, \\
My crumb kingdom. \\
And doesn't planet \word{Earth} \\
Look good from this perch. \\
Rats in the sky. \\
Eat, fly, survive. \\

Their mind is miles from their bodies. \\
Forgot the joy of simply being. \\
They miss the magic of the mundane. \\
The way raindrops race down windowpanes. \\
Always hurrying, never arriving. \\
Nothing truly dangerous, nothing surprising. \\
Liberated by wings, unburdened by worry. \\
Forgot the destination but enjoyed the journey. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walked}

Scooby doo wop, doo wop…

Joke's on you, \\
You stupid men. \\
I just went to the costume shop, \\
And bought myself some wings. \\
