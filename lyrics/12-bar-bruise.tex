\song{Muckraker}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Clear the cobwebs off my brain. \\
Ants have came. \\
It smells like rain. \\

Pissin' shit off porcelain. \\
I'll rake the muck. \\
It's just my luck. \\

Oh no, oh no. \\
Muckraker. \\

\song{Nein}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Never, never, never, never, \\
Had much too much, I'm sick of it. \\
My body's full of poison shit. \\
Never, never, well, ha ha, ha, ha! \\

Shit, never again! \\

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. \\
Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein! \\

\song{12 Bar Bruise}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Better be slave. \\
Make some money. \\
So when it gets ruff we can bruise some stuff. \\

But look at my dick. \\
I bet you it's limp. \\
Should I quit drink. \\
It makes me think that… \\

12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise. \\

Gotta be strong. \\
Make me live long. \\
Better not wait for a bottle's sake. \\

All of my friends are looking up dresses. \\
They have not seen the bruise that I've seen. \\
Broo-oo-oo-oo-uize! \\

\song{Garage Liddiard}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

My head. \\
Oh my head. \\
My head's all bleak. \\
And it makes my love so rough. \\

My knees. \\
Oh my knees. \\
My knees are weak. \\
And it makes for walking tough. \\

Oww! Oww! Oww! Ouch! \\

\song{Sam Cherry's Last Shot}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Broderick Smith:]}

Early that morning, the wagon-master of the train came into the post greatly excited, and reported that the dead body of a man and horse had been found in the road about six miles from the post. A company of infantry was immediately ordered out, and proceeding to the spot found the body of \word{Sam Cherry}, pinned fast to the ground by the dead body of his horse. \\

The search was continued, and in the lateral canyon were found the bodies of Sargent Love and the three privates loaded with bullets, mutilated and disfigured, but giving every evidence of having sold their lives as great men should. Trails were examined and the whole story worked out. \\

The party traveled along the road nearly to the entrance of the canyon of the Limpia, known as the ``Wild Rose Pass,'' when suddenly about thirty mounted Indians dashed from the bushes along the stream, cutting it off from retreat towards the Fort, and driving it up the lateral canyon. \\

Suspecting a trap, Sam Cherry suddenly turned, dashed through the line of Indians, regained the road, and ran for life, away from the Fort, followed by a number of yelling savages. He was evidently doing well, when his horse stumbled and fell, breaking his neck, and pinning Sam's leg to the ground. In an instant he was surrounded by the exultant Indians. \\

Raising himself slightly, Sam fired five shots at his enemies, then turning the muzzle against his own temple, he escaped the tortures of their vindictive rage by his ``last shot.'' The baffled and terrified Indians went away as fast as their ponies could carry them, not touching the body, not even taking the arms. \\

Such is the way out in the west. People die by extreme barbaric ways. But we're taking their land, and in return they take our viscera and spread it across the \word{desert} plains. \\

\song{High Hopes Low}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Well I ain't dumb. \\
But I ain't that smart. \\
And I can't spell. \\
But I can sound it out. \\

Gotta keep your high hopes low. \\

\song{Cut Throat Boogie}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

As a child I felt inclined. \\
To fold my ears in twine. \\
Never once was I confined. \\
I picked and choosed about my ride. \\
So buckle me in before we set sail ahead. \\
For it smells like cabbage. \\
Got way too stale like death. \\

Oh you're white as a ghost. \\
I never felt so pale. \\
As the blood dripped across the floor. \\

So put it buried in your chest. \\
With the rest of your drunken regrets. \\
Inches from your jugular. \\
As the room fills in front of ya. \\
It took them long enough. \\
For them to stop and suggest. \\
Hey we better get him some help. \\
We better get him out of here. \\

How did I manage to cope as the blood soaked? \\
Through my clothes and to the floor. \\
From outside to the bathroom door. \\
I was inches from my life. \\
Yeah that's what keeps me up at night. \\

Oh how did I survive? \\
(You shoulda died!) \\
How did I manage to cope? \\
(Being alive.) \\
After all it was just a \\
(Innocent play fight.) \\
I hope they don't stop to sympathise. \\

Stitch up the past to cure their whoremented heart. \\

Tormented \word[dream]{dreams} it's all left in between… \\

\song{Bloody Ripper}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Push me down I will not crack. \\
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back. \\
I said it, and you heard. \\
That murky bottle's cuttin' me some slack. \\

But it's like all I wanna do. \\
Sink my teeth in you. \\
You already told me to. \\
You said it's alright. \\

\song{Uh Oh, I Called Mum}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Uh oh, uh oh. \\
Uh oh, uh oh. \\
Uh oh, uh oh. \\
Uh oh, uh oh I called Mum! \\

I bought a funny glob. \\
I put it in my gob. \\
I had anxiety. \\
I couldn't help myself. \\
But call Mum. \\

\song{Sea of Trees}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Oh hell I'm feeling underwater. \\
My head is sinking like a stone. \\

And hell I'm feeling kinda sick / like a prick. \\
I don't know what's the use in it. \\

And when you're feeling suicidal. \\
Sometimes you've just got to unfold. \\
