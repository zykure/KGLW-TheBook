\word{Nonagon infinity} opens the door. \\
Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\
Wait for the answer to open the door. \\
Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\

1, 2, 3! \\
Loosen up. \\
Time to drop. \\
Fuck shit up. \\
Don't forget about it. \\
My coffin's all I see. \\
Lately. \\
Robot stop! \\

Loosen up. \\
Time to drop. \\
Fuck shit up. \\
Don't forget about it. \\
My coffin's all I see. \\
Lately. \\
Robot stop! \\

My body's overworked. \\
It's just the same I know. \\
When can my body work. \\
Cold static overload. \\
My body works I know. \\
It's just the same I know. \\
My only difference. \\
Is robot influence. \\

I'm up here for the \word{weirdo swarm}. \\
I'm the door when you come for more. \\

1, 2, 3! \\
Limber up. \\
Time is up. \\
Fuck shit up. \\
Don't forget about it. \\
My coffin's all I see. \\
Lately. \\
Robot stop! \\

My body's overworked. \\
It's just the same I know. \\

Cold static overload. \\
My body works I know. \\

My only difference. \\
Is robot influence. \\

Upload me to the robot brain. \\
I'm the drudge that goes again and again. \\

Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade. \\
The robot's here if the robot's paid. \\

My body's overworked. \\
It's just the same I know. \\
When can my body work. \\

\song{Big Fig Wasp}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Any wasp I see. \\
It's a fig wasp. \\
Pearly guillotine. \\
It's a fig wasp. \\
And when the harvest's clean. \\
There's a fig wasp. \\
It's a winged machine. \\
It's a fig wasp. \\

Insects grow \\
In my pome? \\

\song{Gamma Knife}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Milk and honey for my body. \\
C'mon through the door, see it's your unborn self. \\
Seen it before. \\
Fake \word{soul}-butter made of rubber. \\
Stick it in the skin, see it's a wealth of life. \\

Gamma knife. \\
Gamma knife. \\
Gamma knife. \\
Gamma knife. \\

Gamma knife. \\
Nice. \\
Knife. \\
Gamma knife. \\

Crack the whip I'll jump the hoop. \\
Gamma. \\
Cut the skin and bend the truth. \\
Gamma. \\
All I wanted was my youth. \\
Gamma. \\
All in favor of this troop. \\
Gamma knife. \\

\song{People-Vultures}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

People-vultures. \\
\word{God} approaches. \\
Final hearing. \\
What else have I got left to spew down? \\

People-vultures waiting to begin. \\
Deadly ulcers feeding on my skin. \\

People-vultures waiting by my stage. \\
Wild dogs escaping from their cage. \\

People-vultures. \\
God approaches. \\
Final hearing. \\
What else have I got left to spew down? \\

People-vultures. \\
God approaches. \\
Final hearing. \\
Disappearing. \\
Tainted voodoo. \\
Headless guru. \\
Final head-spin. \\

What else have I got left to spew down? \\
What else have I got left to spew down? \\
What else have I got left to spew down? \\
What else have I got left to spew down? \\
What else have I got left to spew down? \\

People-vultures crowding at my door. \\
Parasites are eating more and more. \\

\song{Mr. Beat}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\

Latent gun beamed for my head. \\
It's a wonder that I tread. \\
Over worn ground through my youth. \\
Making all my \word[dream]{dreams} come true. \\

Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\

Happy days seem so absurd. \\
Lightning that's unlikely heard. \\
\word{Nova} sunshine while I nap. \\
Making all my dreams so sad. \\

Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\

Don't miss the bar we play here. \\
Already ringing in my ears. \\
Don't miss the bar it's right here. \\
Only a beat disappears. \\

Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\

Only miss a beat. \\
Only miss a beat. \\
Only miss a beat. \\
Only miss a beat. \\

Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat -- only miss a beat. \\
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat. \\

\song{Evil Death Roll}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

You started everything. \\
You started killing things. \\
You started severing limbs. \\

Evil death roll. \\
Now. \\

You float and wait for me. \\
Your scales are hard and green. \\
Open your jaw for me. \\

Evil death roll. \\
Now. \\
Evil death roll. \\
Now. \\

The night is young -- full of sin. \\
Time to slither away again. \\
I can see our history hanging on a knife. \\

So let's start dueling here. \\
I have nothing to hear. \\
Well I'm grinning ear to ear. \\

Evil death roll. \\
Now. \\
Evil death roll. \\
Now. \\

The night is young -- full of sin. \\
Time to slither away again. \\
I can see our history hanging on a knife. \\

So let's start killing things. \\

You distort the notion of the place. \\
The \word[universe]{universes'} other face. \\
The speed of light has slowed apace. \\
The universes' other face. \\

What it is. \\
Impossible. \\
Gravity. \\
The universe. \\
Has me. \\
Invisible. \\
Face. \\

\word{Nonagon infinity} opens the door. \\
Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\
Wait for the answer to open the door. \\
Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\

Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\
Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\
Wait for the answer to open the door. \\
Nonagon infinity opens the door. \\

1, 2, 3, 4! \\

The night is young -- full of sin. \\
Time to slither away again. \\
I can see our history hanging on a knife. \\

So let's start killing things. \\
'Cos you started everything. \\
And let's start severing limbs. \\

Evil death roll. \\
Now. \\
Evil death roll. \\

I climb up the stalk and plant the bean. \\
The universe is a machine. \\
That has awoken from a \word{dream}. \\
The universe is a machine. \\

\song{Wah Wah}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\

Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah wah. \\

I can feel the \word{Earth} is moving. \\
Underneath my hoofed foots earthing. \\
Fire protrudes from whence I'm pointing. \\
Fading every jewel. \\

Thronged upon the rock and metal. \\
There's a horde inside this temple. \\
Mass around your favourite \word{devil}. \\
Learn to make them cry. \\

Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\

Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah wah. \\

See him hover way up high. \\
He is the bat with 16 eyes. \\
He has a thirst to satisfy. \\
A craving for your blood. \\

Now here come the \word[wolf]{wolves} with whips. \\
And 40 goats with pitchfork sticks. \\
And look there is a lunatic. \\
He wants to make you cry. \\

Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\

Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah. \\
Wah wah wah wah wah. \\

I'm the chieftain of your feelings. \\
I'm the \word{God} of air you're breathing. \\
You can not escape my dealing. \\
I will make you cry. \\

\song{Road Train}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

The spawn of \word[satan]{Satan's} back. \\
It's made of steel and black. \\
It comes to bring you pain. \\
It comes again and again. \\

Road train. \\

The spawn of Satan's here. \\
It's come to bring you fear. \\
It sets the road aflame. \\
It comes to kill and maim. \\

Road train. \\

Lights that shine like bulging eyes. \\
Keep on trucking through the night. \\
The vortex opens through. \\
Drive right in and straight through you. \\

The spawn of Satan comes. \\
It's carting oil and drums. \\
It's racing down the lane. \\
With oily fiery rain. \\

Road train. \\

26 gears of petrol power. \\
Keep on trucking hour by hour. \\
One man is at the \word{wheel}. \\
He's the dog at Satan's heel. \\

Across the \word{desert} to the trees. \\
Obliteration of the place. \\
From the fire into the sea. \\
\word{Nonagon infinity}. \\
Is coming! \\

The spawn of Satan speeds. \\
The road beneath it bleeds. \\
It comes to bring you shame. \\
It comes again and again. \\

Road train. \\

Burning wheels of fiery red. \\
Keep on trucking till we're dead. \\
The \word{beast} is angry too. \\
Drive real fast and eat up you. \\

Nonagon infinity. \\
Nonagon infinity. \\
Nonagon infinity. \\
Nonagon infinity. \\
Nonagon infinity. \\
Nonagon infinity. \\
Is coming! \\
