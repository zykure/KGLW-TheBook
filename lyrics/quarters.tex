\song{The River}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Once you're in the zone \\
The \word{river} flows down like a full stone. \\
Water is your bed, \\
The ripples cushion your head. \\

I can't believe it, it is frozen. \\
It's not the first time, I had noticed. \\
She will deliver, I am floating. \\
Trust in the river. \\
I had floated down, floated down. \\
Floated down, floated down. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Floated down, down down, down down… (The river.) \\
Down, down down, down down… (The river.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Once you're where I led \\
It will be clear what I had said. \\
Float without a home. \\
The river flows like another long road. \\

I can't believe it, it is frozen. \\
It's not the first time, I had noticed. \\
She will deliver, I am floating. \\
Trust in the river. \\
I had floated down, floated down. \\
Floated down, floated down. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Floated down, down down, down down… (The river.) \\
Down, down down, down down… (The river.) \\

Frozen over home. \\
The fading light shines on the white stone. \\
Melt your little zone. \\
And sink into the waterfall flow. \\

I can't believe it, it is frozen. \\
It's not the first time, I had noticed. \\
She will deliver, I am floating. \\
Trust in the river. \\
I had floated down, floated down. \\
Floated down, floated down. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Floated down, down down, down down… (The river.) \\
Down, down down, down down… (The river.) \\

\song{Infinite Rise}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Set straight, Vibrate. \\
Need a hug, Coffee mug. \\
Minor flop, Don't stop. \\

What's more? \\
What's it for right now? \\

Days drop, Hearts stop. \\
Days we've traveled and hearts unraveled. \\
Heart attack, hit me back. \\
Pigsty, don't cry. \\

Cat's eyes, capsize. \\
Making time, lifeline. \\
Limelight, no right. \\

What's more? \\
What's it for right now? \\

Nice light, sunrise. \\
Bound together like boys in leather. \\
Raisin bread, wreck the head. \\
Crack pipe, red light. \\

\word{Satan} is hatin'. \\
Days old bread mould. \\
\word{Jesus} kills us. \\
Exalt, my fault. \\

Daylight, insight. \\
Free roam, go home. \\
Bell tollin', \word{hell} holin'. \\

What's more? \\
What's it for right now? \\

Freestyle, mMeanwhile. \\
Whitewash, kKibosh. \\
Stranger, danger. \\
Lightning, frightening. \\

Sell \word{soul}, keep whole. \\
Make some money, eat some honey. \\
Make friend, keep them. \\

What's more? \\
What's it for right now? \\

Loose mind, kook time. \\
Getting better, wearing sweater. \\
High brow, cash cow. \\
Infinite rise now. \\

Fate's game, right as rain. \\
Tinned spaghetti is good for brekky. \\
Daybed, rest head. \\
Brown moth, red sloth. \\

Look smart, rake art. \\
Golden \word{dragon}, subway taggin'. \\
Go nuts, make fuss. \\

What's more? \\
What's it for right now? \\

Carpool, people. \\
Oars and paddles, horse and saddles. \\
You're gone, so long. \\
Day's great, go play. \\

Playwright, blindside. \\
Before, bedsore. \\
Deep grill, sit still. \\
I'll cook a big chook. \\

\song{God Is In the Rhythm}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Earth by the \word{Moon}. \\
Darker days come soon. \\
Owl sings a tune. \\
Surely she knows too. \\

Bird is waiting. \\
Expectating. \\
\word{God} is in the rhythm. \\

\word{Earth} by the \word{Sun}. \\
Brighter days to run. \\
Rain knows the Sun. \\
Knows it's not time to come. \\

Rain is waiting, expectating. \\
God is in the rhythm. \\

Seasons move. \\
Everybody knows it's true. \\
Spring brings a dew. \\
Hibernates winter's tune. \\

Summer's waiting, expectating. \\
God is in the seasons. \\

Summer's waiting, expectating. (Expectating.) \\
God is in the seasons. \\

Trees know it too. \\
The perfect time to bloom. \\
The leaf asks the sun. \\
Knows his time has come. \\

The leaf is waiting, expectating. \\
God is in the rhythm. \\

Wind blows a song. \\
From the \word{desert} to the pond. \\
Frog waves the wand. (Waves the wand.) \\
And the wind blows on beyond. \\

Frog is waiting, expectating. \\
God is in the rhythm. \\

Earth by the stars. \\
We have all come from \word{Mars}. \\
We all know it too. \\
We belong to the soup. \\

We are waiting, expectating. \\
God is in the rhythm. \\

We are waiting, expectating. \\
God is in the rhythm. \\

\song{Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn. \\
Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn. \\
Lover conceal me, all of my body, I won't go. \\
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn. \\

Lover, it's all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer. \\
Look in the \word{sky} see, inside a jet stream, goodbye. \\
Caught in a wind beam out in the sky stream, mornin'. \\
Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer. \\

My lonely wings are ready for flight. \\
The ocean is breathing between you and I. \\
My lonely wings don't make it right. \\
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly. \\

Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone. \\
Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn. \\
Lover believe me, it's not the TV, it's more. \\
Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone. \\

My lonely wings are ready for flight. \\
The ocean is breathing between you and I. \\
My lonely wings don't make it right. \\
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly, high. \\

Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer. \\
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired. \\
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight. \\
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer. \\

My lonely wings are ready for flight. \\
The ocean is breathing between you and I. \\
My lonely wings don't make it right. \\
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly, high. \\
