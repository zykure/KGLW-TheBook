\song{Change}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig}

Who should we please? \\
Who's to believe? \\
Who should we change for? \\
Who could we be? \\
When my race is done, how did I run? \\
Did I par the course and pass the baton on? \\

Vote with your feet. \\
Make company. \\
Form a military of peace and kill the king. \\
Be a citizen of planet \word{Earth}. \\
Be a bigger man or woman 'cause we all can change. \\

Change. \\
Change… \\

Change for its own sake. \\
Uniformity gave me a belly ache. \\
I want a mutiny. \\
My mind is finally awake. \\
Who could we be given equal opportunity? \\
What could we see given equal chance to actually see change? \\

Change. \\
Change… \\

Is this what we consider changing for the better? \\
Maybe. \\

Is this what we consider changing? \\
Ah, save me. \\
Is this what we consider changing for the better? \\
Maybe. \\
Is this what we consider changing? \\

I'm changing. \\
I'm changing. \\
Is this what we consider changing for the better? \\
Maybe. \\
Is this what we consider changing? \\
Change… \\

Is this what we consider changing? \\
I'm changing. \\
I'm changing. \\
Is this what we consider changing? \\

We're changing pace. \\
Higher stakes. \\
So called heroes wearing fake capes. \\
Critically acclaimed. \\
Clinically deranged. \\
Push the buttons. \\
Keep on frontin' 'til they hear the thumpin' \\
Something's coming up the hallway out of the left field lane. \\
Hey. \\
My stomach's turning from the vermin up-skirt observing power hungry. \\
Tryna draw the curtains from the public person. \\
But there ain't no slicker villain that's deserving a serving on the killing floor. \\
Put 'em on the chopping board for all to see. \\

I'm like a sniper hiding in the tower. \\
I'm picking them off one by one. \\
Gateway drug to the only solution. \\
Cutting out their tongues before they jump the gun. \\
I'm the like the cupid trying bring the \word{love} but you keep getting out of my range. \\
No strings on my bow with broken arrows. \\
Running low on ammo to make a change. \\

Buildings that you know. \\
People come and go. \\
Are a certain way. \\
Always are the same. \\
And then you get the news that obliterates your view. \\
Amputate your truths. \\
The significance has changed. \\

Hospital inane. \\
Meaningless and grey. \\
But lie within the walls and the significance will change. \\
What would it take for us to change the game? \\
Maybe our existence is significance in vain. \\
The significance has changed. \\
Maybe our existence is significance in vain. \\

Buildings that you know. \\
People come and go. \\
Are a certain way. \\
Always are the same. \\
And then you get the news that obliterates your view. \\

Hospital inane. \\
Meaningless and grey. \\
But lie within the walls and the significance will change. \\
What would it take for us to change the game? \\
Maybe our existence is significance in vain. \\

What would it take to build an ark for me and my friends? \\
Escape this old place with all that creeps and fish in the sea. \\
And all that flies and all the bugs inside of me. \\
Take all the good things and leave the \word{human} beings. \\

Da da da da da da da da… \\

Burnin' up. \\
Burnin' up. \\
Burnin' up. \\
Burnin' up now. \\

Change. \\
Change… \\

\song{Hate Dancin'}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

I still hate dancing. \\
Oh I still hate dancing. \\
I still hate dancing. \\
Oh I still hate dancing. \\

Whatever you say. \\
Whatever you don't say. \\
Whatever you say to me won't sway me. \\

She's coming straight for me. \\
The world's frozen. \\
I'm sweating. \\

I still hate dancing. \\
Oh I still hate dancing. \\
I still hate dancing. \\
Oh I still hate dancing. \\

Slow-mo at the disco. \\
And she's putting out her hand to tango. \\
Oh no! \\
Her hips are too close for comfort. \\
Now I'm losing control of myself. \\
What the hell is coming over me right now. \\
I feel like I'm about to freak out from the waist down. \\
No more caring about what other people think. \\
Let 'em kick up a stink. \\

I might like dancing. \\
Oh I might like dancing. \\
I might like dancing. \\
Oh I might like dancing. \\

Whatever you say. \\
Whatever you don't say. \\
Whatever you say to me is gonna swing me. \\

I was just joking. \\
I love it. \\
I was just kidding. \\
I love it. \\

I feel like dancing. \\
Oh I feel like dancing. \\
I feel like dancing. \\
Oh I feel like dancing. \\
I feel like dancing. \\
Oh I feel like dancing. \\
I feel like dancing. \\
Oh I feel like dancing. \\
I feel like dancing. \\
Oh I feel like dancing. \\
I feel like dancing. \\
Oh I feel like dancing. \\

\song{Astroturf}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Cavanagh}

Everything's dead here. \\
Covered with plastic. \\
Everything's fluro. \\
Evergreen matter. \\
Gotta stop grass growin' \\
Cover that wormhole. \\
Gotta stop birds from shitting on my lawn. \\
When it don't matter everything's better. \\
Throwaway plates are better for business. \\
Everything's easy. \\
Better for the \word{Earth} is astroturf. \\

Six \word[butterfly]{butterflies} fluttered by. \\
Looked horrified. \\
``I just hatched from chrysalis. \\
I've only hours, 36. \\
I need a mate to do my biz and this is where I will die. \\
Heartbreaking way to end. \\
I will cry on astroturf.'' \\

Suitable texture. \\
Suitable color. \\
Miniature forest. \\
Better than nature. \\
Make me feel better knowing I won't go out. \\
On my lawn and see an animal. \\
Everything's sterile. \\
Even infertile. \\
Proud of my monster. \\
It's never been straighter. \\
Dog shit \word{heaven}. \\
Better than the Earth. \\
It's astroturf. \\

Six butterflies fluttered by. \\
Looked horrified. \\
``I just hatched from chrysalis. \\
I've only hours, 36. \\
I need a mate to do my biz and this is where I will die. \\
Heartbreaking way to end. \\
I will cry on astroturf.'' \\

Astroturfing. \\
Astroturfing. \\
Astroturfing… \\
Better than the Earth is astroturf. \\

Six butterflies fluttered by. \\
Looked horrified. \\
``I just hatched from chrysalis. \\
I've only hours, 36. \\
I need a mate to do my biz and this is where I will die. \\
Heartbreaking way to end. \\
I will cry on astroturf.'' \\

\song{No Body}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

I floated up and for the first time I could relax and unplug. \\
My friend, it felt good. \\

To shuffle off this mortal coil. \\
To rise like oil in water. \\

To be not real. \\
To have no \word{soul}. \\
To have no body. \\

I woke to an eye-adjusting fright. \\
Baptised in the light and found myself in purgatory white. \\
Dead again in the void. \\

What was the lesson, \word{God}?
No, no, no, no body… \\
Are you real or not? \\
No, no, no, no body… \\

In \word{death} I know \word{life} was a hallucination. \\

\song{Gondii}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\word{Human} being domesticated. \\
\word[gondii]{Gondii's} in the amygdala. \\
Human being contaminated. \\
Living-murdered feline worshiper. \\

What it feels like is it feels like it's \word{dream}-like. \\

Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself. \\
Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself anymore. \\

What it feels like is it feels like it's dream-like. \\

Human being manipulated. \\
Gondii drizzles serotonin. \\
Human being lubricated. \\
Drowning in oxytocin. \\

Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself. \\
Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself anymore. \\
I've got oocysts inside my head. \\
I can't control myself. \\
Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself anymore. \\

So am I the bird or am I the worm? \\
Do have I free will? \\
Do have I free thought? \\

Am I the chicken or am I the egg? \\
Have I liberty? \\
Have I my wings? \\

You shouldn't fight it or deny it. \\
Just breathe in and embrace it. \\
Symbiotic Gondii choir sings a song of fuzzy minds. \\

So am I the dog or am I the cat? \\
No, it's neither one. \\
I am the \word{rat}. \\

Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself. \\
Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself anymore. \\
I've got oocysts inside my head. \\
I can't control myself. \\
Can't get a message to my brain. \\
I can't control myself. \\

\song{Exploding Suns}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

Exploding golden \word{Sun}. \\
Bursting radiation. \\
Get on your feet and run for the shelter. \\
A change is gonna come. \\
8 minutes and 20 seconds. \\
Over before begun. \\

And all that was green is fire and dust. \\
And all that was blue has dried up. \\
And all that we knew has dropped off the edge of waterfalls. \\
What's after \word{Armageddon}? \\

Giant star. \\
A thousand tears. \\
Liquid \word{Moon}. \\
A billion years. \\
Music of the brightest spheres. \\
A gong for remodelled frontiers. \\
Vibrates like the string of time. \\
Dissonant storyline. \\
The past and future intertwine. \\
The sun explodes at any time. \\

Exploding sun erupts. \\
Causing deadly destruction. \\
The time has come. \\
Redux. \\
Final endgame. \\
A burning fireball. \\
No more white dwarf. \\
Our sins to be absolved. \\

And all that was green is fire and dust. \\
And all that was blue has dried up. \\
And all that we knew has dropped off of the edge of waterfalls. \\
What's after Armageddon? \\

Giant star. \\
A thousand tears. \\
Liquid Moon. \\
A billion years. \\
Music of the brightest spheres. \\
A gong for remodelled frontiers. \\
Vibrates like the string of time. \\
Dissonant storyline. \\
The past and future intertwine. \\
The sun explodes at any time. \\

The sun explodes at any time… \\

\song{Short Change}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Who should we please? \\
Who's to believe? \\
Who should we change for? \\
Who could we be? \\
When my race is done, how did I run? \\
Did I par the course and pass the baton on? \\

Change. \\
Change… \\
