\song{I'm In Your Mind}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Everybody's lazy when they're tired. \\
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride. \\
And everybody's filing into line. \\
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride. \\. \\

When I'm in your mind. \\
Then I'm in your mind, oh! \\

While everybody wants to suck you dry. \\
And dig a little deeper in your mind, c'mon, deeper. \\
Everybody's lazy because they're fried. \\
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride . \\

When I'm in your mind. \\
Then I'm in your mind, oh! \\
When I'm in your mind. \\
Then I'm in your mind, oh! \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Do-do-do-do… \\

You can watch your movies in 3D. \\
It's so strange. \\

With cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane, cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, ooh! \\
Do-do-do-do… \\

You can color everything you see. \\
It's so strange. \\

With cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane, cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, ooh! \\

\song{Empty}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Empty. \\

\word{Life} is nothing like it used to be. \\
People used to be so nice to me. \\
Feeling so empty. \\
Empty. \\

There is nothing deep inside of me. \\
\word{Love} is nothing like it used to be. \\
Feeling so empty. \\

Life is \word{death}. \\
It's because I shot it through its head. \\
I'm wandering around so lazily. \\
And feeling so empty. \\

And now I know. \\
It's because I never set it stone. \\
And I'm wandering around so lazily. \\
Feeling so empty. \\

But I don't feel empty when I'm with you. \\
I feel like you level me too. \\
Who? Empty. \\
Empty. \\

There is nothing deep inside of me. \\
\word{Love} is nothing like it used to be. \\
Feeling so empty. \\

Life is \word{death}. \\

And feeling so empty. \\

And now I know. \\

And I'm wandering around so lazily. \\
Feeling so empty. \\

But I don't feel empty when I'm with you. \\

Who? Empty. \\

What I got myself into? \\
What I got myself into? \\
Empty. \\

What I got myself into? \\
What I got myself into? \\

\song{Hot Water}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Hot water, hot water… \\

Eat up, vomit. \\
Date line, repay. \\
System failure. \\
Wish for old way. \\
Straighten, bend it. \\
Decline, spend it. \\
Believe sceptic. \\
Everybody's standing in \\

Hot water, hot water… \\

Sheet of paper. \\
Mountain raper. \\
Moment silence. \\
I am spineless. \\
Echoes ending. \\
Whispers trending. \\
Heat is coming. \\
Everybody's stranded in \\

Hot water, hot water… \\

\song{Am I In Heaven?}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I've got ideas in my brain \\
About the end of the world \\
That I won't even say. \\
When all the bricks that built our brains \\
Will be turned into sand \\
By the eternal wave. \\

If we save her, we'll live on a star \\
Because Mother Nature made everybody else so far. \\

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven…? \\

Well everybody that I knew \\
Has jumped right in and taken over you. \\
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue. \\
The lesson rings again, \\
Repeats within my brain. \\
Let's all put her to the test. \\
C'mon suck our mother's breast. \\

And everybody that I knew \\
Has taken bits and pieces out of you. \\
And I swear, even the \word{sky} has changed its blue. \\
The lesson rings again, \\
Repeats within my brain. \\
Let's all put her to the test. \\
C'mon suck our mother's breast. \\

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven…?

Well everybody that I knew \\
Has jumped right in and taken over you. \\
And I swear even the ocean's changed its hue. \\
The lesson rings again. \\
Repeats within my brain. \\
Let's all put her to the test. \\
C'mon suck our mother's breast. \\

I've got ideas in my brain \\
About the end of the world \\
That I won't even say. \\
When all the bricks that built our brains \\
Will be turned into sand \\
By the eternal wave. \\

If we save her, we'll live on a star \\
Because Mother Nature made everybody else so far. \\

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven…?

\song{Slow Jam 1}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I need to slow my mind down low… \\

And when it feels like coming on. \\
Boy it makes it hard to talk \\
For me, for me. \\

I need to slow my mind down low… \\

And when it feels like coming on. \\
Boy it makes it hard to talk \\
For me, for me. \\

\song{Satan Speeds Up}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

You brought us to your gift \\
Of generosity. \\
And all our silly games \\
Wreak havoc on your soils. \\
When I stop to think of all that. \\

Every \word{life} is like a song \\
That takes forever to be sung. \\
When all our silly games \\
Wreak havoc on our spoils. \\
When I stop to think of all that we've done. \\
\word[satan]{Satan's} at the door. \\

Every second, every minute, \\
Every hour, every day, \\
He's watching you \\
And passing judgement to everybody you hold dear. \\
When I stop to think of all that we've done. \\
Satan's at the door. \\
Who's he looking for? \\

\song{Her and I (Slow Jam 2)}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I had to put up some kind of a fight. \\
It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my \word{love}. \\
The \word{Sun} shone through into a wave of thought. \\
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her. \\

Her will will shine from up above on us. \\
Because everyday I build on precious her and I. \\
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel. \\
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love. \\
So the sun can shine a little brighter. \\

On her and I… \\

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love. \\
The sun shone through into a wave of thought. \\
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her. \\
Her will will shine from up above on us. \\

Because everyday I build on precious her and I. \\
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel. \\
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love. \\
So the sun can shine a little brighter. \\
