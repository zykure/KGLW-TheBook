\song{Planet B}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Open your eyes and light the fluid. \\
Get into it, petrol syphon. \\
Low on meals, browning fields, \\
Bury children. \\

Urbanisation, scarification. \\
Population exodus. \\
There is no planet B. \\
Open your eyes and see. \\

Open your eyes and shoot the dingo \\
While this shit goes out the window. \\
Multi factions, rusting tractors, \\
Dying heroes. \\

Only way through is colonisation. \\
Acclimatisation. \\
Population exodus. \\
Monetisation, civilisation. \\
The operation has begun. \\
There is no planet B. \\

Patient seasons \\
Blacked out for ages. \\
\word{Dreaming} of cake. \\
Snowflakes blanket \\
Old \word[desert]{deserts}. \\
Outskirts disperse. \\
\word{Earth} is a blank verse. \\
Last hearse. \\
Dry nurse. \\

Open your eyes and see. \\
There is no planet B… \\
Open your eyes and see. \\

Sinners are grinners. \\
Ear to ear. \\
Baby \word{Jesus} sheds a tear. \\

\song{Mars For The Rich}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Red \word{Mars} for the rich! \\

I'm just a poor boy living frugally. \\
I see Mars on TV, I see people happy. \\
I work fields with blistered fingers. \\
I look starward, that world has no place \\
For me. \\

Red Mars, the tsars live large. \\
Red Mars for the rich, rich. \\

Mars for the privileged, \word{Earth} for the poor. \\
Mars terraforming slowly, Earth has been deformed. \\
Just forget it ya ain't comin' here, tThe ticket's too dear. \\
I stare sadly into my beer -- That world has no place \\
For me. \\

Red Mars, the tsars live large. \\
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich. \\

Red Mars, the tsars live large. \\
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich, rich. \\

\song{Organ Farmer}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Make the incision, careful precision. \\
Blood minestrone. \\
Decomposition, new \word{life} christened. \\
Fatty rolls of brie. \\

Organ farmer. Organ farmer. \\

Delicatessenof our profession. \\
Growing muscle meat. \\
Bring in the carcass, waken departed. \\
Speak our blasphemy. \\

Organ farmer. Organ farmer. \\

Counterfeit hypocrite \\
Runs the mall; runs 'em all. \\
\word{Citadel} guards it well. \\
Counting coins, counting stem cells. \\
Wiretap divinity, \word{human} laboratory. \\

Kill the squid, cut the tree. \\
Arrogant human being. \\
Meadow's vast, body parts pulled apart. \\
Partly smart, partly art, partly not. \\
Part of me wants to breathe eternally. \\
Part of me wants to cut out my heart. \\

Farm colossal. \\
Wake the fossil \\
In the fields of beef. \\

\song{Superbug}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Superbug comin' up, feels like he'll never stop. \\
Should'a used phages, instead you took ages. \\
Superbug gave a shrug \\
And ate all your prescription drugs \\
And never ever, ever, stopped. \\

Deadly contagious and intergenerational. \\
Never ever, ever, stops. \\
And never ever gives a fuck. \\

Pony up, join the club. \\
Shake my hand, let's run amok. \\

Superbug in my blood. \\
Superbug, made of the disturbing stuff… \\

Superbug comin' up, H1N1 was a flop. \\
Antimicrobial resistance is futile. \\
Superbug is like a truck, \\
Penicillin is a duck \\
That's sitting on the road for luck. \\

Faceless and ageless and simply outrageous. \\
Never ever ever stops \\
And never ever gives a fuck. \\

Unnecessary anti-B's \\
Likely killed \word{humanity}. \\

Superbug in my blood. \\
Superbug, made of the disturbing stuff… \\

\song{Venusian 1}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Venusian 1. \\

Forest desertify, ocean wave amplify. \\
Constant tornado \word{sky}, black water, no supply. \\
Otherworld surrogate, interstellar our escape. \\
Sulfur star liberates, gotta beat the outbreak. \\

Oh, we're going to the second planet from the \word{Sun}. \\
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin. \\

\word{Death} admirer, ground of fire. \\
I heard there's a holy yellow sky. \\
Just make sure you close your eyes. \\
Venusian 1. \\

Made of junk from the \word{Earth}. \\
\word{Human} waste, how absurd. \\
Journey is childbirth. \\
Plant a flag, start a church. \\
Sharp as ice in the night. \\
Cutting space; satellite. \\
To a sphere set alight \\
We escaped parasites. \\

Oh, we're going to the second planet from the Sun. \\
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin. \\

Floating helium, blimp of freedom. \\
Outside air will bring you death. \\
Just make sure you hold your breath. \\
Venusian 1. \\

Ve-nu-si-an 1. Ve-nu-si-an 1. \\

(Ve-nu-si-an 1.) \\
I heard there's a holy yellow sky. \\
Just make sure you close eyes. \\

(Ve-nu-si-an 1.) \\
Outside air will bring your death. \\
Just make sure you hold your breath. \\

There is one planet V. \\

\song{Perihelion}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Space is the place for the \word{human} race. \\
Chasing the race for the new place. \\
Days on our old place waste. \\
Starship's team full of everybody keen. \\
Pilot in the twilight is a deep \word{dream}. \\
Man and machine convene. \\

Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion… \\

Giver of \word{life} and the giver of speed. \\
Ever we take, even her gravity. \\
Her glowing beauty is something to see. \\
Bigger and brighter, she cometh to me. \\

Solar mountain comes on the perihelion. \\
No re-routing, only counting 'til we're done. \\
Shouting sins until we're in the \word{Sun}. \\
Peri-Perihelion. \\

Melting \word[human]{humans} and everything they bring. \\
In a blink, the Sun will drink their things. \\
Grinning Sun has sinners for dinner. \\

Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion. \\
Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion. \\

Giver of life and the giver of speed. \\
Ever we take, even her gravity. \\
Her glowing beauty is something to see. \\
Bigger and brighter, she cometh to me. \\

Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion… \\

\song{Venusian 2}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

In the lap of the gods, the last one did explode \\
In a blaze all firey. \\
I sit in the cockpit, it may be a sinking ship \\
But fortune favours bravery. \\

Road trip with me, Vitamin V \\
In focus now. \\

Venu-sian 2. \\

Fingers getting warm and eyes are turning gold. \\
Evil twin is coming in. \\
Weathering the storm, I put the birdie down. \\
For the sin I have a grin. \\

Road trip with me, Vitamin V. \\
I see the ground. \\

Venu-sian 2. Venu-sian 2. \\

\song{Self-Immolate}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I have gone insane-o, I lust for volcano. \\
Be with molten \word{lava}, give me my nirvana! \\
I have no vertigo, I lust for tornado. \\
Be a leaf upon air, Venusian mal-de-mer. \\

Venusian: sickness dire. \\
I want to be set on fire. \\
Venusian. \\
Gather while I \\
Venusian-ly catch on fire. \\

\word{Auto-Cremate}. Self-Immolate. \\

Like a bird in a cage, airostat-habitat. \\
To motion I am slave. \\
Give me \word{Hell}, I want that! \\
Venusian sickness. \\
Venusian bilious. \\
Venusian nausea. \\
Venusian mal-de-mer. \\

Venusian: sickness dire. \\
I want to be set on fire. \\
Venusian. \\
Gather while I \\
Venusian-ly catch on fire. \\

Auto-Cremate. Self-Immolate. \\

\song{Hell}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

\word{God}, it's pretty hot down here under surface. \\
Anti-Christ has tempted me with a purpose. \\

Remember where to enter. \\
Remember where to enter. \\
The door to \word{Hell} is amber. \\

Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell. \\

Here I was thinking I'd die. \\
I see a thousand flies and wings and tail and spines. \\

Nausea-less, resoluteness, near the entrance. \\
\word{Satan} points me \\
To the \word[rat]{rat's} nest. \\

Remember where to enter.\\
Remember where to enter. \\
The door to Hell is amber. \\

Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell. \\

Remember where to enter. \\
The door to Hell is amber. \\

Fifteenth infantry paratroop \\
Into the propylene, new scene. \\
Hell's where they wanna be. \\
Infest the rats' nest. \\
