\song{A New World}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

As soon as the dust settles you can see \\
A new world in place of where the old one had been. \\

Your skin is crawling with dry crusted mud \\
And your naked feet are wet in a pool of your blood. \\

And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud \\
That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud. \\

And as your eyes accommodate, there appears by the meadow \\
A brute like a bear with a long dark shadow. \\

And you violently shake over what you have seen \\
As you remembered the tale of the \word{Altered} \word{Beast}. \\

\song{Altered Beast I}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I think I see \\
An \word{altered} \word{beast} \\
By the tree. \\

Take a peek if you would dare. \\
Half made of man, half of bear. \\

He came from underneath. \\
I met an altered beast! \\

I think I see \\
An altered beast \\ \\
By the creek. \\

Altered face and altered skin. \\
Altered horde of altered kin. \\

He came from underneath \\
I met an altered beast! \\

I think I see \\
An altered beast \\
In my \word[dream]{dreams}! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

In a dream you can wake in your bed without pain. \\
But know with conviction it's here you'll remain. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

I met an altered beast! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

With an unsteady gait the critter moves forth. \\
You feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth. \\

And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread. \\
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head. \\

And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain. \\
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain. \\

Closer he comes making dust out of stone. \\
Forsaken, you are, and what's more, all alone. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I think I see \\
An altered beast \\
By the tree. \\

I met an altered Beast! \\

\song{Alter Me I}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

For all its revulsion and warp and taboo \\
A part of you wants to be \word{altered} too. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Altered \word{beast}. \\
Alter me. \\
Altered beast. \\
Alter me! \\

Altered beast. \\
Alter me. \\
Altered beast. \\
Alter me! \\

\song{Altered Beast II}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

And now dear listener we cross to the foe. \\
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo. \\

I am the sabre! The catapult and bat! \\
The top of the food chain in my habitat! \\

I am the demon bearing misery and fear! \\
And I spy you convulsing from way over here! \\

I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces. \\
I could make you bleed crimson tears from the lesions. \\

But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get \\
Is to take over your body and to be in your head. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I see you. \\
I want to \\
Break your head. \\
Crusty bread. \\

I won't quit \\
If you quip. \\
See to it \\
That you slip. \\

I see you. \\
I want to \\
Seize your brain \\
I'd like to put it in my head! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat. \\
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Tell me would you honestly \\
Dare to face up next to me. \\
Sugar coated pills won't keep \\
You from feeling so woozy. \\

I am an \word{altered} \word{beast}! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

What harm could a mere mortal like you do? \\
I am the golden \word{wolf} and you are caribou. \\

My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork. \\
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I see you. \\
I want to \\
Make a waste \\
Of your home. \\

I won't leave. \\
I might tease. \\
I'll be here. \\
Await your \word{death}. \\

I see you. \\
I want to \\
Seize your brain. \\
I'd like to put it in my head! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

I see you are nervous, I see you are fumbling. \\
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling! \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Tell me would you honestly \\
Dare to face up next to me. \\
Sugar coated pills won't keep \\
You from feeling so woozy. \\

I am an altered beast! \\

Your dumb \word{human} head is full of naivet√©. \\
Your impending fate is to be one with me. \\

\word{Altered} \word{beast}. \\
Alter me. \\
Altered beast. \\

Now we cross to our friend on the monster's plate. \\
In time he will turn and reincarnate. \\

\song{Altered Beast III}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I know I see \\
An \word{altered} \word{beast} \\
By the tree. \\

Find a place to hide \\
Where I could steal a peep. \\
Look to the \word{sky} \\
And I see angels weep. \\

And he said: \\
``I see you. \\
And I can see right through. \\
I see you. \\
And I will take you to my altered world.'' \\

Nine white teeth. \\
My gums bequeathed. \\

Hair on my skin. \\
And I'm feeling beastly. \\
Feel it trickle in. \\
A new \word{life} with me. \\

And he said: \\
``I see you. \\
And I can see right through. \\
I see you. \\
And I will take you to my altered world.'' \\

Nine white teeth. \\
My gums bequeathed. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you're deformed. \\
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I see you. \\
I can see right through. \\
I see you. \\
I can see right through. \\
I see you. \\
I can see right through. \\
I see you. \\
And I'll take you to my altered world. \\

I am an altered beast! \\

No more consternation, no longer insalubrious. \\
The \word{beast} \word{DNA} has dug into your nucleus. \\

\word{Altered} beast. \\

Altered beast. \\
Alter me! \\

\song{Altered Beast IV}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head. \\
No \word{love}, no pain and no fear of dread. \\

Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort. \\
And your savoir-faire is to kill for sport. \\

You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle. \\
And lust to feel so bad that you'd force a giggle. \\

So crooked and curled is your point of view \\
There is no other creature more malicious than you. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I'm completely satisfied. \\
My other \word{life} I will not miss. \\
An \word{altered} \word{beast} until I die. \\
And I will not give up on this. \\
Never! \\

True, I went to hell and back. \\
But it was so I could be this. \\
An altered beast until the end. \\
And I will not give up on this. \\
Never! \\

I don't feel heinous, I \\
Don't feel no pain, I don't \\
Feel nothing, I don't feel \\
Anything, I don't feel \\
Heinous, I don't feel no \\
Pain, I don't feel nothing. \\
I don't feel anything. \\
Altered beast within me. \\

I don't feel heinous. \\
I don't feel no pain. \\
I don't feel nothing. \\
I don't feel anything. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

You're ruthless and savage and sadistic and vindictive. \\
And you find \word{human} flesh is incredibly addictive. \\

But the longer you live and the longer you kill. \\
There's a void that gets harder and harder to fill. \\

The void that you feel within would suggest \\
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest. \\

And whatever you do there's no turning back. \\
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Emptiness inside of me. \\
And hollowness all around me. \\
I cut myself to see it bleed. \\
And now I don't feel anything. \\
Never! \\

Insincere and trivial. \\
The world is void of all meaning. \\
And gone is all that's visceral. \\
And now I don't feel anything. \\
Never! \\

I don't feel heinous, I \\
Don't feel no pain, I don't \\
Feel nothing, I don't feel \\
Anything, I don't feel \\
Heinous, I don't feel no \\
Pain, I don't feel nothing. \\
I don't feel anything. \\
Altered beast within me. \\

I don't feel heinous, I \\
Don't feel no pain, I don't \\
Feel nothing, I don't feel \\
Anything, I don't feel \\
Heinous, I don't feel no \\
Pain, I don't feel nothing. \\
I don't feel anything. \\
Altered beast within me. \\

I don't feel heinous. \\
I don't feel no pain. \\
I don't feel nothing. \\
I don't feel anything. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

The sole thing that will make your void obsolete \\
Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Altered beast, \\
Alter me. \\
Altered beast, \\
Alter me! \\

I think I see \\
An altered beast \\
Inside me! \\

I am an altered beast! \\

\song{Life/Death}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

Are you you? Are you me? \\
Or someone in between? \\
You lost track inside the labyrinthine. \\

You lost your will and your sanity. \\
You certainly lost your \word{humanity}. \\

In \word{life} you have taken much more than your worth. \\
Now it's your turn to give back to the \word{Earth}. \\

May you return to the ground and ossify. \\
It's time for you to die, die, die. \\

\song{The Reticent Raconteur}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

There is a secret I've been keeping, a story true and genuine. \\
And I have not the candid heart to keep its burden clandestine. \\

For its gravity is as weighty as a mountain capped in snow. \\
And its memory repeats inside of me ostinato. \\

And every time I think of the poor lot I recall. \\
The fear upon their faces and the doomed fate of them all. \\

I saw \word{death} become of light and \word{life} become of fire. \\
I saw it from my hiding place within the quagmire. \\

I bringeth forth the drama, unabridged and unignored. \\
The battle of the \word{Balrog} and the mighty lightning lord. \\

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\song{The Lord of Lightning}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Lord of lightning shifts his gaze. \\
Points his strong finger our way. \\
Electricity escapes. \\
Leaves destruction in his wake. \\

Lightning‚Ä¶ \\

\word{Nonagon}, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yup! \\

Floating fire. \\
Golden wire. \\
Silver trails. \\
Flashing spire. \\

Guns are cracking. \\
Bombs are smacking. \\
Cat o' tails. \\
Whips her lashings. \\

Lord of lightning moves our way. \\
Sends a crooked look at me. \\
Electricity escapes. \\
Lights the \word{sky} in citrine fleece. \\

Lightning‚Ä¶ \\

Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yup! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

One more time the vault lights up a carnival of paint. \\
I endeavour to watch the panic but I worry that I will faint. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Floating fire. \\
Golden wire. \\
Silver trails. \\
Flashing spire. \\

Guns are cracking. \\
Bombs are smacking. \\
Cat o' tails. \\
Whips her lashings. \\

Lord of lightning's closer now. \\
Our world's only rain and cloud. \\
I'm not sure we have the power. \\
Need to smite this evil down. \\

Lightning‚Ä¶ \\

Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yup! \\
Nonagon, nonagon‚Ä¶ \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

And from the lord's electric snare. \\
One goes in his electric chair. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Lord of lightning shifts his gaze. \\
Points his strong finger our way. \\
Electricity escapes. \\
Leaves destruction in our wake. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

His electric trap was electric cyanide. \\
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Lightning, yup! \\

Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yes! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes \\
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise. \\

Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught alight! \\
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night. \\

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\song{The Balrog}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

\word{Balrog}, Balrog. \\
Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, Balrog, yep! \\

You made the atom split. \\
It caused a massive rift. \\
And he came screaming through. \\
Here to bite the head from you. \\

Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, yep! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

Balrog fears not the lightning lord. \\
He's fixed on us, has Him ignored. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Feel a tingle \\
Crawling up your left arm when you \\
Think of evil \\
Lurking in the darkness where you \\
Shine your eyesight. \\
Something tells you this is not right. \\
Take some advice. \\
Have you heard the murmurings of‚Ä¶ \\

Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, yep! \\

You caused a massive rift. \\
You made the atom split. \\
And it came screaming through. \\
Here to bite the head off you. \\

Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, Balrog. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at its expression. \\
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression. \\

I fear that \word[god]{God's} a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot. \\
He is here, fully formed and glowing red and lapis hot. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Heated menace. \\
Comes to gouge the heart out from us. \\
Blazing zealot. \\
Preaching on the \word{Apocalypse}. \\
I don't want to \\
Submit to his awful torture. \\
Save me from him. \\
Have you heard the murmurings of‚Ä¶ \\

Balrog, Balrog, Balrog. \\

Skin begins to burn. \\
There's nowhere we can turn. \\
There's no way we can win. \\
The \word{devil} puppets him. \\

His pyre muscles flex. \\
We are his next subjects. \\
His power has us floored. \\
Kneel before the overlord. \\

Balrog, Balrog, Balrog, \\
Balrog, Balrog, Balrog. \\

Balrog, Balrog, Balrog, \\
Balrog, Balrog, Balrog. \\
Balrog, yes, oh! \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

For them the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe. \\
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemathe. \\

And as they prepared for afterlife, there appeared the endemic monstrosity \\
The lighting lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity. \\

Furious he pummeled his breast and a blaze alit the \word[heaven]{Heavens}. \\
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog the lord's finger beckoned. \\

Clouds begin to tear. \\
\word{Sky} is bleeding hair. \\
\word{God} is weeping tears. \\
You are full of fears. \\

Vehement lightning quake. \\
Head begins to ache. \\
Lord has thunder snake. \\
Balrog he will break. \\

\note{[Leah Senior:]}

And thus revenge was fruitless for one who had been turned. \\
And we are reminded who lords over this \word{altered} world. \\

Floating fire sky. \\
Everything will die‚Ä¶ \\

Floating fire. \\
Golden wire. \\
Silver trails. \\
Flashing spire. \\

Guns are cracking. \\
Bombs are smacking. \\
Cat o' tails. \\
Whips her lashings. \\

Lord of lightning safe he \\
Pulls a golden stake. \\
Launches into space and \\
Mutters to the \word{beast} one word: \\

``Lightning!'' \\

And as the acrid Balrog corpse smoulders just like it began \\
Its crimson-orange light melts into the setting sun. \\

And leaving us not without a final clap of light \\
The Lightning Lord escapes as day fades into moonless night. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Dig-i-tal! \\

Despondent, lugubrious, no future. \\
We turned our bodies to computer. \\
We are our own nature abuser. \\

No future! \\
Computer! \\
Abuser! \\

I can tell every day I stay. \\
All the whiteness turns to grey. \\
All the grey to cimmerian. \\
As the black is setting in. \\

Digital black. \\

We've sunken into our illusion. \\
We've fashioned colossal confusion. \\
I am the word of the last human. \\

Illusion! \\
Confusion! \\
Last \word{human}! \\

I can see it all around the land. \\
I can feel it with the back of my hand. \\
I can hear a roaring silence. \\
Of the murky caliginous. \\

I've heard the dark \word{beast} has said \\
That the world is like a brittle egg. \\
He can crush it with only breath. \\
And he can bring a black wave of \word{death}. \\

Digital black. \\

The last who feels the pain from the wound. \\
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb. \\

A wretched \word{life} in this \word{altered} place. \\
There must be more I can embrace. \\

No future! \\
Computer! \\
Abuser! \\

Digital black. \\

Illusion! \\
Confusion! \\
Last human! \\

Digit, digit, digit. \\

I can tell every day I stay. \\
All the whiteness turns to grey. \\
All the grey to cimmerian. \\
As the black is setting in. \\

\song{Han-Tyumi, The Confused Cyborg}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Han-Tyumi:]}

Hello, \\
My name is \word{Han-Tyumi}. \\
I am a cyborg. \\

Born, \\
If you may call it that. \\
In a world that is dense and black. \\

Created without a desire to draw breath. \\
Without a desire to have being. \\
Without a yearning just to be. \\

I'd like my desire back. \\
My \word{life} back. \\
My \word{soul} back. \\
My \word{humanity}. \\
Oh how I long for it. \\

For an era I have meditated. \\
Like the primordial \word{Buddha} beneath the bodhi. \\
My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered. \\
I climbed and I clambered. \\
And I ambled upon some understanding. \\
The gold beneath the virtual rainbow. \\

I am bereft of two human things. \\
Two things that a cyborg can never do. \\
Two things that I strive for. \\
Two things between myself and mankind. \\

\word{Death}. \\
And. \\
To vomit. \\

I want the perspiration. \\
I want the nausea. \\
I want to be sick. \\
I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets. \\
I want it to find passage through my cold figure. \\
I want to make a mess. \\
I want the odour. \\
I want the spectacle. \\
And I want it again. \\
I want it all. \\

And I would like to die. \\
A noble death. \\
Or a coward's death. \\
A hero's death. \\
Or a lonely death. \\
To die in the arms of a lover. \\
Or the arms of an alien. \\
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses. \\
And then to be gone. \\
Expired. \\
Perish. \\
Fallen. \\
Dead. \\
For evermore. \\

\song{Soy-Protein Munt Machine}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Han-Tyumi:]}

So I built a machine. \\
A human machine. \\
I made it with steel. \\
And soy-protein. \\

Born from a test tube. \\
And into a vat. \\
To live and to heave. \\
And to die just like that. \\

\song{Vomit Coffin}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\

I don't feel blessed. \\
With the vomit \\
In my chest. \\
I feel like coughing. \\

Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\

Queasy green rotten scoff. \\

Vomit cough. \\

\note{[Han-Tyumi:]}

And when I declared to my design. \\
Like Frankenstein's monster. \\
``I am your father, I am your god. \\
And you the magic that I conjure.'' \\

The thankless swine. \\
The blasphemous jerk. \\
My creature had no \word{love} for me. \\
Which made me berserk. \\

``I am covered in vomit. \\
I am coated in sick. \\
I have no name and no place. \\
This is no way to live.'' \\

So I took over my creation. \\
The spew coated protein. \\
I plugged myself in. \\
And became one with machine. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I don't feel blessed. \\
With the vomit. \\
In my neck. \\
I feel like death. \\

Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\
Vomit coffin. \\

Filthy green rotten scoff. \\

Vomit, vomit, vomit‚Ä¶ \\
Cough! \\

\song{Murder of the Universe}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie}

\note{[Han-Tyumi:]}

The spatter becomes a spray, \\
The spray becomes a stream, \\
And the stream becomes a waterfall. \\
Munt is finally cascading from my input. \\

The creeping sick moves from my breath \\
And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body. \\
I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins \\
And eats through the walls of my cells. \\

It bleeds through the pores of my skin \\
And it smells good. \\
It drops from my crotch on to the floor \\
And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads. \\

Inside my body, \\
The pressure is too great \\
And like some ancient geyser I erupt. \\
My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast. \\

Vomit bomb. \\
Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me. \\
I am vomit vomiting. \\
I grow and disperse. \\

Bleeding through walls, \\
I force myself upon others. \\
I slide up legs and crawl down throats. \\
I integrate. \\
I am double, \\
Triple. \\
I am ten times the size. \\

I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile. \\
I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents. \\
Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble. \\
It tastes good. \\

Ten thousand times bigger. \\
I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires \\
At the speed of light across vast electrical networks. \\
I am electric. \\
I am on fire. \\
This is sex. \\
I am every one and every zero. \\

One million. \\
I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell, molecule and atom I can find. \\
I am cancer. \\
I am flying. \\
I am a rainbow unfurling across the \word{sky}. \\
I am floating. \\
I am omni. \\

Five hundred million. \\
The world is my interior. \\
It no longer spins. \\
It is \word{altered}. \\
My density forces me outward. \\
I am in orbit. \\

One billion. \\
I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms. \\
I am the weather. \\
I am the \word[sun]{Sun's} heat. \\
I am the night sky. \\

Five hundred billion. \\
The solar system is puke. \\
To the Kuiper belt and beyond. \\
I fill the void. \\
Exploding suns vomit comets. \\
Comets vomit acid rain. \\
Spilt milk over the milky way. \\

One trillion. \\
The stars are my cells. \\
Racing faster outwards, \\
Upwards, \\
Downwards, \\
Inwards. \\
Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse. \\
Every-nowhere. \\

I am heavy. \\
I am gravity. \\
Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst. \\
Expansion. \\
I shoot arrows of time in all directions. \\
I am a blackhole shitting into the void. \\
I tear through the skin of perception and into the next. \\

Nonillion. \\
The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent. \\
Like rising damp, \\
Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos \\
And it topples like soggy bread. \\
I am dark energy accelerating. \\
Multiverse. \\

Entanglement. \\
I am time. \\
Centillion. \\
Time is sick. \\
Critical density. \\
Contraction. \\
Singularity. \\
Everything and nothing. \\
\word{Life} and \word{death}. \\
Murder of the universe. \\
