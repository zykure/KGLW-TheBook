\song{Stressin'}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I'm stressin' \\
About what I've been missin'. \\
And I'm feeling stressin' is an instinct. \\
Stress colours all of my dreams orange. \\
I'm dreaming stressin' is an instinct. \\
Now I'm biting down on my jaw. \\
Oh, now it's making all my teeth sore. \\

Seein' trouble. \\
One thing to another. \\
I'm feeling stressin' is an instinct. \\
My partner is a clever lover. \\
She told me stressin' is an instinct. \\
Now I'm biting down on my jaw. \\
Oh, now it's making all my teeth sore. \\

I'm stressin' \\
About what I've been missin'. \\
And I'm feeling stressin' is an instinct. \\
Stress colours all of my dreams orange. \\
I'm dreaming stressin' is an instinct. \\

\song{Vegemite}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I love, I love my \word{Vegemite}. \\
It's strong as hell and black as night. \\
I keep my \word{love} all screwed up tight. \\
And spread it thick whenever \\
I like… I like… \\

Vegemite. \\
I like. \\
Vegemite. \\
I like… I like… \\

And when everyone's getting grumpy 'cos it's early. \\
I'll have breakfast with my girlfriend. \\
And we'll have toast. \\
With avocado. \\
And tomato. \\
And Vegemite. \\

'Cos I love, I love my \word{Vegemite}. \\
It's strong as hell and black as night. \\
I keep my love all screwed up tight. \\
And spread it thick whenever \\
I like… I like… \\

Vegemite. \\
I like. \\
Vegemite. \\
I like… I like… \\

\song{It's Got Old}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I'm always saying I'm sorry. \\
And you're always saying you're broke. \\
I'll keep my hands on the steering \word{wheel}. \\
If you keep your eyes on the road. \\
But it's not like you anyway. \\
To hide your sad face away. \\
It ain't gonna stay the same. \\
'Cos it's got old. \\

You'll always run me in circles. \\
Chasing me round like a mouse. \\
I'll keep on watching this movie, woo-oh. \\
If it means I can stay at your house. \\
But it's not like you anyway. \\
To hide your sad face away. \\
It ain't gonna stay the same. \\
'Cos it's got old… \\

\song{Work This Time}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie}

\note{[Joey Walker:]}

I knock hello but I see that you've got hypothermia. \\
So I place a block to stop the rot and hope that I can warm you up. \\
Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind? \\
Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined. \\

Can never lay my whole head down. \\
Can never lay my whole head down. \\
Can never lay my whole head down. \\
I know I'm lazy, but baby I will work this time. \\

It's kind of funny that I live the poetry I can not write. \\
But you my beauty shall be fixed forever loosely in my heart. \\
Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind? \\
Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined. \\

Can never lay my whole head down. \\
Can never lay my whole head down. \\
Can never lay my whole head down. \\
I know I'm lazy, but baby I will work this time. \\

\song{ABABCD}

\writtenby{Walker}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie \& Joey Walker:]}

Ababcd. \\
Will show you how it feels \\
To be stuck outside your sanity \\
And wrapped around infinity. \\
I want to leave but I can't conceive that \\
I'll snap back to reality. \\

\song{Sleepwalker}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. \\
Well I want to, I want to, I want to. \\
I want to walk in your shoes. \\

Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. Sleepwalker. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. \\
Well I want to, I want to, I want to \\
I want to sleepwalk with you. \\

I caught you sleeping on the wrong side of the bed. \\
So I got up and switched my side. \\
Your voice gets hoarse when you get too cold. \\
I'll warm you up. Wo-oh! Warm you up. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. Sleepwalker. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. (Sleep. Sleep. Sleepwalker.) \\

If you're thinking then you're thinking too hard. \\
So squish your brain and numb your pain. \\

Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. Sleepwalker. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. Sleepwalker. \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. \\
Well I want to, I want to, I want to \\
I want to sleepwalk with you. \\
Oh No! \\
Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee. \\

\song{Hot Wax}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Hot wax comin' under the door. \\
Hot wax comin' under the floor. \\
Hot wax creepin' under the hill. \\
Hot wax creepin' under the sill. \\

Hot wax. \\
C'mon get around. \\
Everybody's learning how. \\
Come on a safari with me. \\

Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. \\

\note{[Ambrose Kenny-Smith:]}

Hot wax slippin' under the seat. \\
Hot wax drippin' under the feet. \\
Hot wax leakin' under the sink. \\
Hot wax leakin' under the drink. \\

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

Hot wax comin' under the lord. \\
Hot wax comin' under the door. \\
Hot wax comin' into the brain. \\
Hot wax comin' into the maze. \\

Hot wax. \\
C'mon get around. \\
Everybody's learning how. \\
Come on a safari with me. \\

Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. \\

Hot wax. \\
C'mon get around. \\
Everybody's learning how. \\
Come on a safari with me. \\

Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. \\

\note{[Ambrose Kenny-Smith:]}

Hot wax slippin' under the seat. \\
Hot wax drippin' under the feet. \\
Hot wax leakin' under the sink. \\
Hot wax leakin' under the drink. \\

Hot wax risin' from beneath. \\
Hot wax risin' from the leaves. \\
Hot wax runnin' under my bed. \\
Hot wax runnin' up my leg . \\

Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. Hot wax. \\

\song{Crying}

\writtenby{Craig}

\note{[Cook Craig:]}

Came in my window crying. \\
Said that she's sick of all his lying about me. \\
I said I ain't got time for her. \\
I'm gonna close the door when I go walking \\
Out! Out! Out! Out! \\

Came to me Monday Morning. \\
Interrupted me in my mid-morning yawning. \\
He said the same thing that she said. \\
Well I just turned to him and said that she ain't \\
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! \\

Baby you always acted like baby you never cared. \\
With the way you act girl, you're bound to make your guy \\
Cry! Cry! Cry! Cry! \\

Well I ain't gonna be the one to watch you fall down the stairs. \\
With the way you act girl, you're bound to make your guy \\
Cry! Cry! Cry! Cry! \\

\song{Homeless Man In Adidas}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\note{[Stu Mackenzie:]}

I'm not lonely. \\
I'm not lonely. \\
I'm not lonely. \\
The city keeps me company. \\
The city keeps me company. \\
The city keeps me company. \\

Sit on the roof. \\
Watch the cars travel past. \\
Ain't no way of getting lonely. \\
And I'll sit real still and watch everyone go fast. \\
With only me. \\

Lay on the bay. \\
Watch it all float away. \\
Ain't no way of getting lonely. \\
Watch all the people and the bikes come my way. \\
With only me. \\

I'm not lonely. \\
I'm not lonely. \\
I'm not lonely. \\
