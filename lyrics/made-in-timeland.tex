\song{Smoke \& Mirrors}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Kenny-Smith/Cavanagh/Harwood]}

Smoke and mirrors steering clear of here. \\
Watch you tear up interior. \\
Inferior actions, mysterious convoluted satisfaction. \\
To see the suffering of \\
All those like you're above us and not among us. \\
It's not a concern to see you squirm like a worm in the beak of an eagle. \\
It's evil. \\
Step back, we must progress to our sequel. \\

Smoke and mirrors disappearing when you're near us. \\
Uncontactable, retractable. \\
You must be held accountable for this. \\

Timeland… \\

Quit the chit-chatter, backstabber. \\
Face up to the matter on a silver platter. \\
Ducking and diving, you've been hiding. \\
Undermining our capabilities. \\
This operation is breaking, you're flaking, it's all unfolding at the seams. \\

Another puppet to your strings. \\
Another sucker with a broken wing. (Smoke and mirrors.) \\
Another puppet to your strings. \\
Another sucker with a broken wing. (Smoke and mirrors.) \\
Another puppet to your strings. \\
Another sucker with a broken wing. (Smoke and mirrors.) \\
Another motherfucker trying to live the dream. \\
