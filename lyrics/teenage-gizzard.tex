\song{Sleep}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

1, 2, 3, 4! \\

I got up early \\
And you've got me up too. \\
And you pull me under, \\
And you say ``My leg''. \\
But I don't wanna \\
Go back to sleep again. \\
But I dont' wanna \\
Stay like this for 5 more minutes. \\

And you always sleep \\
Before the day goes. \\
It's time to wake up. \\

Slit your wrists, slash your neck. \\
