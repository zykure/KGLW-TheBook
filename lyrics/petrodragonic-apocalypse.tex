\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh/Craig/Kenny-Smith/Harwood]}

Oh holy rabble, we art ensnared to quiver liketh rippled air \\
Diocese of did melt sand \\
Worship with thy chroming hand \\
Coal-black cloud horizon maketh landborn petromyzon \\
Summon forth thy \word{motor spirit} \\
Drink the fuckin' gas and killeth \\

Light the fuel \\
Propagate oxygen and heat \\
Deify motor spirit \\
Kiss goodbye the weak \\

Oh holy frontier art unbound \\
Thee kiss thy \word{god} \\
I kisseth ground \\
I holdeth flame yond burns at night \\
A seraph of \word[isaiah]{Isaiah's} light \\
Touch thy lips and purge thy skin \\
Holy water \\
Eyes within \\
By thee, we sleep and die for you \\
Ignite m'lord, we ride for you \\

Motor spirit, motor spirit, motor spirit… \\

Black buckets everywhere brimming, spewing millionaires \\
Rotting ancient zooplankton squashed below the megaton \\
Sweet juice on my lips \\
Motorised apocalypse \\
See metal crunch and hear it \\
Highway death by motor spirit \\

Light the fuel \\
Propagate oxygen and heat \\
Deify motor spirit \\
Kiss goodbye the weak \\

High octane aviation \\
Gasoline leak inhalation \\
Paint chromer \\
Broken home \\

Gasket blown \\
Pop the bonnet \\

Piston wheeze \\
The messiah on their knees \\
Beg the wind \\
Beg the tree \\
Beg the bug for mercy \\
Motor spirit \\

Petrol king, abdicate \\
Human-kind, exonerate \\

Dire fate shall plague our land \\
Hurricanes shall sweepeth sand \\
The winds doth howl and moaneth \\
Homes and lives overthrowneth \\
But hark, brave occultists, bold \\
Rise to save the world from cold \\
Weaveth magic spells with care \\
Banish the hellish nightmare \\

Dance beneath the moon's bright glow as charms they work to and fro \\
But alas, fire doth grown despite witches' ebb and flow \\
Fires rage with wild intent destroying all they present \\
The heat doth scorch the landeth \\
Naught but ash in thy handeth \\

End doth near \\
We cannot hide as the earth doth shake and writhe \\
Turn to sin with hearts sincere \\
Block the way that led us here \\

Motor spirit, motor spirit, motor spirit… \\

\song{Converge}
\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh/Craig/Kenny-Smith/Harwood]}

Lo, a sight most dire and bleak from yon celestial perch doth speak \\
The earth shake \\
The earth quiver \\
As dazzling twisted pillars deliver \\

Thank \word{god} for space and that I'm here \\
The vacuum black \\
The last frontier \\
Grey snakes slither across country \\
Magnetising and converging \\

From the \word{ISS}, ungodly high, chaos madness evolves below nigh \\
A tempest of great force and might \\
A storm of such unparalleled fright \\
The winds do howl \\
The rains do pour \\
The lightning strike \\
The thunder roar \\
The elements rage in wild excess \\
A spectacle of cruel finesse \\
Houses, cities, torn asunder \\
The havoc wreaked, a sight to wonder \\
May the lord have mercy on us all \\
Pray the storm which risen, thus shall fall \\

Trained forever to leave the ground \\
The ruined garden \\
Churning clouds \\
Convergence be into the eye \\
Storm dilates and people die \\

Converge, converge, converge… \\
Storm surge \\

I am removed \\
I am a cloud \\
In peering down, I am endowed \\
\word{Motor spirit}, that brought me here \\
Fly to the moon \\
I have no fear \\

The twisters worm as tyres burn \\
The screeching rims \\
Gale force winds \\
The judgement day \\
Murder tycoon \\
Ground control from the birds eye view \\

In wind tunnels stained red with blood \\
All that was green to shit and mud \\

Morphing twirling to single beast \\
\word{Humanity} \\
Tantalising feast \\

Feast on blood of feckless \\
Pull the tide like a blanket \\

The storm is the aether \\
Quintessence and preacher \\
Aura drinker \\
Spirit shrinker \\
The one true God \\
Vile smile \\
'Mental yolks \\
Nymphs, sylphs and pygmy's choke \\
Drink the blood \\
Tasting Tchort \\
What hath God wrought? \\

Converge, converge, converge… \\

Hungry crawling fat grey rat snake seems faster than the speed of light \\
Snail trail through the green glade \\
Killer zig zags and flying kites \\
Watching from the silence of space at lords converging in their place \\
Generals destruction in wake \\
Combining fronts \\
Ultimate quake \\

Mass destruction \\
Challenging \\
Human race unravelling \\

Verily winds converge with force \\
Deadly splendour over the course \\
Immersed in a mouse trap for land \\
Forever writ in nature's hand \\
The land doth mourn \\
The sea doth grieve \\
For loss of life \\
Destruction seen \\
Verbose words fail to convey the horrors that this storm do slay \\

Converge, converge, converge… \\

\song{Witchcraft}
\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh/Craig]}

In the fields once green and gold \\
Where the summer's breeze was bold \\
A supercell rages and roils \\
Swirling vortex \\
A bubble boils \\
Witchcraft \\
So upon one sable morn when the moon does wane and die \\
A ragged coven convenes performing incantation nigh \\
Witchcraft \\
Taxidermy with eyes of fire \\
Chanting songs above the lyre \\
Miasma of hair and bile hangs heavy with the mother's ire \\
Witchcraft \\
Antlers shed ribbons of blood \\
Draped like thorns upon the brow \\
A crucifixion can end this squall \\
A bible burned with aerosol \\
Witchcraft \\

I call upon the blood-moon goddess for I have but one request \\
I've laid the altar \\
Charged the crystals \\
The circle, I have blessed \\
Witchcraft \\
The four elements are set \\
Septuple trigger fingers bleed \\
Oh horrors, my midnight god, what have you got in store for me? \\
Witchcraft \\

Fire flickered and danced with hues of orange, red and deep burnt blues \\
Snakes slither by, just out of sight \\
Lizard and bat take wing in the night \\
Around the fire, they circle slow and with locked minds a chant did grow \\
Timbers of oak with knots so tight bear witness to spells cast in the night \\

I am \word{Beowulf} \\
I am cat, black \\
Knock the candle from scripture stack \\
I bring justice at moment, right \\
\word{Gila} Monster, set alight \\
Witchcraft \\
Unleash a reptile thinking in terms of only \word{lizard} brain \\
And be not lucky enough to make any mistakes again \\
Witchcraft \\
Like a grenade in a fist, the air ignites, a bloody mist \\
Moon cycle shifting \\
Demon lifting \\
Beowulf, grifting ritualist \\
Witchcraft \\
Alas, the cat disrupts the prayer and turns it on meekest there \\
The tiny creature, a harmless skink, transforms into a mythic king \\
Witchcraft \\

\song{Gila Monster}
\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh/Craig/Kenny-Smith]}

Anon, a giant monster roams \\
Creature of magic, not of home \\
He didst gobble each hag he found \\
Screams didst echo, a chilling sound \\
With every wiccan he will devour, he'll grow in strength, in size and power \\
Until one day upon his back, he'll sprout wings \\
A fearsome pack \\
With each meal \word{Gila} grows more \\
A biblical beast of ancient lore \\
With fire in belly \\
Flames in eyes \\
The beast rise to the highest skies \\
So beware, ye witches fair, lest thee be spied by \word{dragon}-glare \\
It'll show not mercy, it is said, but devour thee and leave thee for dead \\

Gila, Gila, Gila.. \\
Monster \\

I'm the Gila \\
Blood spiller \\

Gila, Gila \\
I'm the Gila \\
Card dealer \\
Fate sealer \\
Gila, Gila \\

Gila, Gila \\
I'm the Gila \\
Godzilla guerilla \\

Diamondback climbing walls \\
Puncture wounds \\
Torn and mauled \\
Raging monster \\
Witch brawl \\
Backlash \\
Battlecry \\
Curveball \\
Pushed and probed to the edge \\
No sense of forgiveness \\
I'm the Gila \\
The blood spiller \\
The witch killer \\
I'm the Gila \\

Gila, Gila, Gila... \\
Monster \\

Turncoat projectile \\
Idiot reptile \\
Born in the whirlwind \\
Feral wonderkind \\
Petty feline summoned anew \\
Once was slave \\
Master of you \\
Abomination \\
Hallucination \\
Revenging sinner \\
Witches for dinner \\
I'm the Gila \\

Growing immensely and vastly in size \\
Summoned from the wicca to their demise \\
Sprouting wings \\
Demonic features \\
Horny for bloodlust \\
Lord of pagan creatures \\
Blacker than space \\
Its eyes are distant suns \\
Devouring its disciples like mischievous sons \\
In the forest of my mind runs a torrent of fire \\
The real me beneath the liar \\
I bide my time to don my crown \\
Tasered bull \\
Gore the clown \\
Compared to me, a pulsar is a lighter flame \\
Compared to mine, their wicca is a mere child's game \\

Gila, Gila, Gila... \\
Monster \\

My eyes feel like they're made of light \\
Boötes void would be made bright \\
I will blind you in the hadal zone \\
Emperor of the abyss below \\

Annihilation of planet \word{Earth} and the beginning of merciless damnation \\

Oh, regret, what a cloud of dread \\
With the cold hand of death ahead \\
Oh, desperation, what a mind killer \\
All hail, king Gila \\

\song{Dawn of Eternal Night}
\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

The winds howled like ravenous wolves, clawing at the mansion's windows and doors. The sky had turned a murky shade of death, as if the clouds themselves were infected with the poison of a dying planet. The humans inside the mansion toiled like frenzied ants, their hands trembling as they performed ancient rituals in feverish synchronicity. Desperate to bend the forces of nature to their will, they attempted to tap into the wellspring of arcane, ritualistic magic. Foolish, in my opinion, but the humans had reached the brink of all possibilities; in their minds, only one remained. They hoped to wield their magic like a shield, protecting themselves from the deadly tornadoes that whipped over the land like whirling dervishes, collecting whole villages and tearing them asunder in the sky. The power they sought was shrouded in mystery, but the cause of the storms was clear. \\

\note{[First paragraph on lyric sheet, but not on song]}

The humans' terror and despair filled the room in a suffocating fog. Palpable, even to me, their pet \word{Gila} Monster. They frantically chanted and burned incense. Eyes, hearts and minds fixed on the swirling maelstrom beyond. They knew that time was slipping through their fingers, that the approaching storms were an unstoppable force, an untamed beast. Still, they persisted, their faith in the occult a tiny ember of optimism amid planet \word[earth]{Earth's} ashes of despair. As the winds grew louder and the mansion creaked and groaned, I knew their efforts were futile. The tornadoes were a force unlike any other, a manifestation of nature's rage and fury. A living fist of god. And no matter the strength of the humans' magic, it was but a flickering candle in the face of a raging inferno. \\

As darkness enveloped the mansion, the humans fervently performed rites, their voices a hymn pleading to ancient deities for deliverance. Dirty fingernails protruded from their robes, their eyes rimmed black from sleeplessness. Despite the vortex's tumultuous force, they persevered in their prayers and offerings. Desperate faith. Blind adherence. Collective insanity. The atmosphere in the room was heavy with the aroma of burning mugwort and myrrh, their voices a harmonic confluence of terror and desire, the monotony of their chanting ensnaring me in a hypnotic trance. I curled my tail around to lay my head upon it and relaxed. The old mansion quivered like a violin bow and the screaming of the wind turned to a sweet song. \\

As I lay in a fog of unconsciousness, my eyes locked with the house cat, \word{Beowulf}, who had been quietly watching from his perch atop a stack of sacred texts. Through the smoke of the mysterious herbs the humans were burning, Beowulf gave me a conspiratorial wink. Before I could decipher the enigmatic gesture, Beowulf stumbled and knocked over a candle, causing the flame to pirouette in the darkness. The humans seemed oblivious to the spilled candle, their focus fully absorbed in ritual. Eyes fixed on the altar and hands moved with graceful purpose as they wove their spells. But as the fire's tendrils creeped across the room like a snake roused from its slumber, it became clear that something was awry. The flames licked and hissed at the corners of the room, the fires hunger and intensity increasing with each passing moment. \\

I inhaled the smoke and felt an intense desire to be one with the fire. And so, I reached out and made contact. A strange energy coursed through my body. Something trembled within me like a \word{Kraken} stirring in its watery grave. An ancient dormant force. My body began to grow and change, my scales shimmering and shifting as I took on a new form. As the fire grew, so did I. My limbs elongated and new wings unfurled, my bones and muscles stretching and expanding to accommodate my new size. My head grew larger and \word{dragon}-like, my jaw widening and my teeth sharpening into deadly points. The fire raged but I didn't burn. I was a phoenix rising from the ashes, a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. My body was a canvas, painted with brushstrokes of smoke and flame. I was a shape-shifter, a changeling, a being of endless potential. My skin was a cloak, shedding its old self to reveal a new, shimmering version. My eyes were windows to a vast, untapped universe. My mind was a labyrinth, a puzzle waiting to be solved. My heart was a forge hammering a new path forward. I was a being of fire and magic, a being of transformation and renewal. A rip in space-time. Born again. A force to be reckoned with. A being beyond human understanding. \\

The humans finally noticed the fire and my transformation taking place. Despite their fear, they continued to chant, their eyes wide with shock and confusion. Avatars to their \word{gods}. Something primal and formidable stirred within me, a force long slumbering, now roused. Profound and terrifying. The flames eagerly devoured me; I knew there was no turning back. Awe radiated from me and the humans saw it. It seemed their incantation had misfired; I was the materialisation of their mistake. They had never seen anything like this before, and their shock and disbelief was palpable. A tangible force in the air. What had gone wrong, I do not know; I paid them no mind. I was consumed by the power that flowed through me and I knew that I was fated for greatness. Nothing stands in the way of destiny. \\

The wind continued to bellow with fierce shrieks, echoing the terrified cries of the humans. It poured a deluge outside and began to pour in through the cracks in the walls. A window shattered, setting off a cascade of exploding glass. I could sense their terror, their despair, as they realised that their time was running out, their rituals useless in the face of nature's fury. Yet they persevered, their voices lifting in a desperate chorus as they implored the ancient gods for protection. The few remaining candles danced in the breeze that blew through the smashed windows. Outside encroached. The voices strained to compete with the deafening roar of the tempest and the cracking of timber as the mansion slowly crumbled into the inferno. Desperate, they called upon all manner of deities both ancient and new but alas, no amount of magic or sacrifice could spare them from the impending disaster. Their magic had turned against them, and the end was imminent. All that remained was to see what fate had in store for them. How pitiable, these reckless fools were. \\

A carnal groan echoed in my belly as I felt a primal urge to feed. The call of the hunt reverberated in my ears. And so, I devoured the humans one by one, their screams of terror and despair painting the air as I feasted upon their bodies, relishing the taste of their hot blood as it cascaded down my throat. I tore flesh. I crunched bone. Death for the humans seemed to be a concoction of fear, hopelessness and relief. Beowulf, too, was devoured, reduced to a charred tangle of fur. As I grew larger and more formidable, my hunger intensified, fuelled by the ancient memories of my ancestors it stirred within me. With each bite growing larger, I transfigured into a dragon. As I consumed them, their shadowy enchantments flowed through me, imbuing me with vigor and vitality. I was no longer a mere pet, but a being of fearsome power, commanding respect and awe. The dragon. The humans, fumbling infants toying with powers beyond their comprehension, were nothing more than sustenance for my insatiable appetite. The corpses of my prey accumulated around me. I knew myself to be invincible, my path unchallenged. \\

As the final human crumbled to the ground, it was clear that the universe had irrevocably shifted. The tempest outside howled with rage, laying waste to all in its path. Like the tornado, I was intoxicated with sheer power, and I would not be sated until I had devoured everything within reach. I unfurled my wings, letting out a triumphant scream as I reveled in my newfound strength. With a burst of energy, I broke through the mansion's ceiling, splinters of wood scattering amongst the great grey columns of air that snaked along the plains outside. I was free. And I knew naught but destruction. I was the embodiment of the humans' reckless tendencies; the land was mine to conquer. I set out into the devastated world, my senses heightened and my hunger driving me forward. \\

And so, above the Earth ablaze, I roam the land a nomad, my wings unfurled in flight as I survey my scorched domain. The horrors I unleash haunt the world like a ghostly presence. I am ruin. I am pandemonium. I am sorrow. I, the personification of terror, born out of \word[humanity]{humanity's} folly and feasting upon its greed and hubris. The storms rage a never-ending deluge; the fires burn with devastation and magnitude. I set the kindling and I fan the flames. The few remaining humans can only hope to hide and wait for the storm to pass. But there is no escape from me and the storm will never pass. I am everywhere. I am the reckoning. I am the dragon. Coal-black cloud chokes the Earth. My flame is the only sun. One by one, all of the living creatures of planet Earth will make their journey to the land of the dead. Until I am the last one standing. \\

Dawn of eternal night. \\
