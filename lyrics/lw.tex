\song{If Not Now, Then When?}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

(Check, check, check.) \\

If not now, then when? \\
When the forest's nearly gone. \\
When the hole's in the ozone. \\
When the bees are gone. \\
If not now, then when? \\
When the ocean's coming up. \\
When the rain just won't stop. \\
When the fire's burning. \\
If not now, then when? \\

If not now, then when? \\
When Big Pharma's ripping me. \\
When my data's tracking me. \\
When my phone is spying. \\
If not now, then when? \\
When my choice is monitored. \\
When computers are cleverer. \\
When our food is poison. \\
If not now, then… \\

This is an emergency. \\
Need to act more quickly. \\
This is no quandary. \\
This is an emergency. \\

This is an emergency. \\
Need to act more quickly. \\
This is no quandary. \\
This is an emergency. \\

When the oceans turn to black. \\
When the animals are dead. \\
When the birds are gone. \\
If not now, then when? \\
When the blue \word{sky} turns into black. \\
When \word{Gaia} hangs by a thread. \\
When all the people die. \\
If not now, then when? \\

\song{O.N.E.}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

One night everywhere. One night everywhere… \\

Dawn has reared its welcome head. \\
I lay in bed bravely \\
Waiting for the day to begin. \\

Hours pass reading the news of the day \
That begins in such a state. \\
I bravely await fate. \\

Am I going insane? \\
Am I able to wake from the nightmare? \\
Can I keep it contained? \\
One night everywhere turned to nowhere. \\

\word{Human} race deserves its steaming fate on a plate. \\
We did exploit the fish of the sea and the birds \\
Of the \word[heaven]{Heavens} and even the bugs in the ground \\
And every creeping thing that creeps on \word{Earth}. \\

Am I going insane? \\
Am I able to wake from the nightmare? \\
Can I keep it contained? \\
One night everywhere turned to nowhere. \\

\song{Pleura}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

(Pleura.)

Bone stock brewed up. \\
Graveyard shoot up. \\
Came in trapdoor. \\
Thrown up on the floor. \\
Servants of the \\
Lord of lung slaughter. \\
The necromancer. \\

\word{Orange baby} \\
Always squealing. \\
Cradle snatch the \\
New world fading. \\
The final test, \\
It takes your breath. \\
Desecrates our grave. \\

Drink the blood of that you spill \\
Underneath the whippoorwill. \\
One more piece of Jenga to pull \\
Then necromancer will thank us all. \\

Eager to assimilate \\
And I choose you to walk on your pleura. \\

Drink the blood of that you spill \\
Underneath the whippoorwill. \\
One more piece of Jenga to pull \\
Then necromancer will thank us all. \\

Suck the \word{life} from what you love, \\
I learnt that from the orange one. \\
No one to answer to after the fall. \\
Necromancer will dance on us all. \\

Drink the blood of that you spill (Pleura. Pleura. Pleura.) \\
Underneath the whippoorwill. (Pleura. Pleura. Pleura.) \\
One more piece of Jenga to pull (Pleura. Pleura. Pleura.) \\
Then necromancer will thank us all. \\

Eager to assimilate \\
And I choose you to walk on your pleura. \\
Cheat me out of living my life? \\
I exercise my right to die. \\

\song{Supreme Ascendancy}

\writtenby{Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

How can you get away with a murder? \\
Scot-free when you're found guilty in the first degree? \\
It's pretty simple when you're so powerful. \\
It's who ya know. \\
Untouchable. \\
Lying through your teeth. \\
Break the doctrine. \\
They're all laughing. \\
Double parking. \\
Tax-free control monopoly. \\
So complacent. \\
It's adjacent to the demons \\
You summon from your faculty. \\

Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery. \\
You're not above the law. \\
No matter your beliefs. \\
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery. \\
You're not above the law. \\
No matter your beliefs. \\

Supreme ascendancy. Supreme ascendancy. \\

\word{Satan} in a cassock casting black magic. \\
Childhoods tragically ripped from their shaking feet. \\
Conscious yet inadequate. \\
The bullshit catalyst. \\
Far flung inaction by the ministry of presbytery. \\

Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery. \\
You're not above the law. \\
No matter your beliefs. \\
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery. \\
You're not above the law. \\
No matter your beliefs. \\
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery. \\
The holy hands of \word{God}, justice impedes. \\

Supreme ascendancy. Supreme ascendancy. \\
Supreme ascendancy. Permanent purgatory. \\

\song{Static Electricity}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Split you and me, static electricity. \\
Static electricity. \\
Split you and me, static electricity. \\

Singularity at the point of contacting. \\
Lightning strikes deep inside \\
Digital cells in my mind. \\
Torn apart like a baguette. \\
Rip the husk from the brown rice. \\
Lacerate the \word{pig} flesh \\
And shape the machine out of clay. \\
Blow the brain up in your hand \\
And replace the ashes with static. \\

Split you and me, static electricity. \\
Static electricity. \\
Split you and me, static electricity. \\

Strangers divergent. \\
They were once one, now they're two. \\
Species come late to the fold. \\
Ships in the night sail on home. \\
Cannonball falls from the \word{sky}. \\
Sever the deck with a mind \\
Made of metal in plain sight. \\
Invisible ball of \word{death} \\
Run by a rogue mutant brain. \\
In a bubble of golden static. \\

Split you and me, static electricity… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Split you and me, static electricity… \\
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity… \\
Split you and me, static electricity… \\

Split you and me… \\
Static electricity. \\

Split you and me, static electricity… \\
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity… \\

\song{East West Link}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

All the highways, like terminal airways. \\
All the highways, like sapien \word{DNA}. \\

We can build a road. \\
We can cut a tree. \\
We can shoot a bird. \\
Nobody will see. \\

All the highways, like terminal airways. \\
All the highways, like sapien DNA. \\

Never ever wanna be \\
On the other side of \word{karma} for digging underworld. \\
Never wanna get up. \\
Never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world. \\

We can kill the worms underneath the trees. \\
We can tunnel in. \\
Nobody will see. \\

All the highways, like terminal airways. \\
All the highways, lastike sapien DNA. \\

Never ever wanna be \\
On the other side of karma for digging underworld. \\
Never wanna get up. \\
Never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world. \\

\song{Ataraxia}

\writtenby{Walker}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Take no position on good or bad. \\
Much watched is the doing, \\
So fuck the tarot's read. \\
The \word{life} I lead, it has a taste. \\
Like milk drank from the teat, \\
Curdles at a certain age. \\

Get with ataraxia. \\
Force it into being. \\
Suck face, ataraxia… \\
Lower the ceiling. \\
What if I amount to nothing at all? \\
Inside, it hits me up, \\
I care too much about what I think. \\

Shame the mirrors that stretch my hips. \\
Mute the hypochondria that whispers spoilers in my ears. \\
I'm not a father yet so don't ask again. \\
Salt the snail and teach it to obtain. \\

Lay in, Ataraxia. \\
Set the kindling. \\
Weigh in. Ataraxia. \\
Absolve me of my skin. \\
Shame him, name him, \\
cut me down to size. \\
Inside, it hits me up, \\
I care too much about what I think. \\

Get with ataraxia. \\
Force it into being. \\
Suck face, ataraxia… \\
Lower the ceiling. \\
What if I amount to nothing at all? \\
Inside, it hits me up, \\
I care too much about what I think. \\

Ataraxia… \\

\song{See Me}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

How can anybody see me when I am invisible and \\
How can anybody be the friend of someone impossible? \\
How can everything in my sight be so far into the distance? \\
How can every day I survive turn so easily to night? \\

How can anybody see me? \\
I'm invisible. \\
How can anybody see me? \\
I'm a shadow here forevermore. \\

How can anybody see me when I am a hidden person? \\
How on \word{Earth} can someone like me be intangible to others? \\
How do all the people do the things that people do around me? \\
How can anybody move when our planet is suffocating? \\

How can anybody see me? \\
I'm invisible. (See me!) \\
How can anybody see me? \\
I'm a shadow here forevermore. (See me!) \\

\song{K.G.L.W. (Outro)}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

K, G, L, W… \\

When the claws come out, \\
Cage me too. \\
I'm an animal too. \\

K, G, L, W… \\

When the claws come out, \\
Cage me too. \\
I'm an animal too. \\

K, G, L, W… \\

When the claws come out, \\
Cage me too. \\
I'm an an-- \\
I'm an an-- \\
I'm an animal, woo! \\
