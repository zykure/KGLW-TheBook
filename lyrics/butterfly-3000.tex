\song{Yours}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Did you know he's yours? \\
He's the \word{wheel} you steer. \\
Tomorrow, still yours. \\
You can lean on him forever. \\

Your man in the \word{sky}. \\
Your bird's lullaby. \\
Your \word{dream} in a dream. \\
Your blue \word{butterfly}. \\
Your winged Frankenstein. \\
Materialised \\
As a figment of dream personified. \\

Did you know he's yours? \\
Your security. \\
Tomorrow, still yours. \\
You can count on him forever. \\

He's yours. \\

Did you know he's yours? \\
He's the wheel you steer. \\
Tomorrow, still yours. \\
You can lean on him forever. \\

Your third sleeping eye. \\
Your friend in your mind. \\
Can make a vision \\
So real and refined. \\
Like lifetime knowledge. \\
Travelling ether \\
From a \word[god]{Godly} cloud to the believer. \\

Did you know he's yours? \\
When you fall asleep. \\
Tomorrow, still yours. \\
He's a gentle breeze. \\
Forever. He's yours. \\

Did you know he's yours? \\

\song{Shanghai}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bye bye \word{Shanghai}, I've become a \word{butterfly}. \\
Born-again overnight. \\
Bye bye Shanghai, bye bye my \word{life}. \\
Born-again overnight. \\

Bright lights up high, \\
Dark thoughts in my mind. \\
Born-again overnight. \\

Bright lights up high, \\
Grey smog all the time. \\
Born-again overnight. \\

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly. \\
Born-again overnight. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Ok, let me my trace my steps. \\
Pour a drink, let's recap the sequence. \\
One minute, you're swigging on a green tea, \\
Next minute, floating on a pillow in a den. \\

From there it gets a little hazy, \\
Like a camera out of focus shaking. \\
Slow motion in the club, free-falling \\
Through my seat, hit the floor transforming. \\

Undergoing complete metamorphosis \\
From a moth caterpillar to chrysalis. \\
Spinning in a silken house like a spider spins a web. \\
I'm a well known insect. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly. \\

Bright lights up high, \\
Grey smog all the time. \\
Born-again overnight. \\

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly. \\
Born-again overnight. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Flying through the Yu garden to the People's Square. \\
That's where you find your happiness. \\
With a little too much Szechuan in the pot \\
Sending sensational content. \\

Neck stuck from looking up \\
At the high rise buildings. \\
Trying to caress enlightenment \\
Through an out of body experience. \\

You're thriving in this environment. \\
Come find me on almost every continent. \\
Coldblooded, but I can't stand the \word{Antarctic}. \\
Guess I've been born again overnight. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly. \\
Born-again overnight… \\

I only wanna run away. \\

\song{Blue Morpho}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Falling upwards through clouds of glue. \\
Anamnesis crashing through. \\
Blurry photos, all I've gained \\
From my last domain. \\

\word{Dream} grips me and pulls me into \\
Global unparalleled new. \\
Metamorphic is my name. \\
Surrender this brain. \\

Blue morpho. Blue morpho. \\

Falling upwards through clouds of glue. \\
Moonless night beckons me through. \\
\word{Morpheus} whispers my name. \\
Massages my brain. \\

Falling upwards through clouds of glue. \\
Split dry sky beckons me through. \\
A hand outstretched calls my name. \\
Time to wake again. \\

Blue morpho. Blue morpho. Blue morpho. \\

Time to wake again, blue morpho… \\

\song{Interior People}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Just on the down low, \\
I'm feeling pretty low. \\
Some days I feel fine. \\
Others, I don't know. \\
I got a sensory road block. \\
I'm in a binary mind lock. \\
So I'm dancing in lockstep \\
To music that I can't hear. \\

Failing farmer, toxic crop. \\
Two white hearts to shake shit up. \\
Pay someone to taste, to smell and \\
Punch trough the dry wall inside my skull. \\

Interior people. \\
A lens flare in my subconscious. \\
The gap of \word{death}, I no longer fear. \\
The interior people. \\

I keep thinking someone \\
Is standing beside me. \\
When I turn to grab 'em, \\
They jump back inside me. \\
They tell me to do things \\
And so does the radio, \\
And learn from the satellite \\
That orbits my shadow. \\

Instigate the paradigm. \\
Play the game and drink the wine. \\
Communicate with the afterglow \\
That radiates between the wall. \\

Failing farmer, toxic crop. \\
Two white hearts to shake shit up. \\
Pay someone to taste, to smell and \\
Punch trough the dry wall inside my skull. \\

Interior people. \\
A lens flare in my subconscious. \\
The gap of death, I no longer fear. \\
The interior people. \\

\song{Catching Smoke}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

For one night, I'm the hero. \\
Suit up, tie. \\
Open the doors to the Oval Office. \\
In this story, I'm president. \\

I've got happiness inside my pocket. \\
It cost me 25 dollars. \\
Maybe we could go halvies? \\
So gimme just a couple hours. \\
Starting fires with soggy timber. \\
Then, I'll have the magic powers. \\

Everybody here is catching smoke, \\
Looking for the ephemeral. \\
Swallowing the \word{Sun} in a moonlit room, \\
Standing at the foot of a \word{rainbow}. \\
Everybody here is catching smoke, \\
Looking for the ephemeral. \\
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown \word{snake}, \\
Sipping on hedonism. \\

Give me 5, it's all I need \\
To inscribe my epitaph while I float. \\ 
O.B.E. -- Am I dead or just paranoid? \\

I've got happiness inside my pocket. \\
It cost me 25 dollars. \\
Maybe we could go halvies? \\
So gimme just a couple hours. \\
Starting fires with soggy timber. \\
Then, I'll have the magic powers. \\
Woo! \\

Everybody here is catching smoke, \\
Looking for the ephemeral. \\
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room, \\
Standing at the foot of a rainbow. \\
Everybody here is catching smoke, \\
Looking for the ephemeral. \\
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake, \\
Sipping on hedonism. \\

Catching smoke. Catching smoke… \\

Hogtied to self-indulgence. \\
Epicureanly living la dolce vita. \\
Just pass the aux \word{cord}. \\

Catching smoke. Catching smoke… \\

Not enough hours in the night \\
To keep me on this stinking horse. \\
Everyone's rolling up pineapples, \\
Writhing in the space between it all. \\
Long-live my decisions. \\

Catching smoke. Catching smoke… \\

\song{2.02 Killer Year}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

It's coming up, beach boys. \\
It's gonna be a lot of fun. \\
The water's getting deeper, \\
It's gonna drown everyone. \\

It's coming up, beach boys. \\
The weather's getting messed about. \\
You better bring boards down, \\
The waves are bigger than a house. \\

2.02 killer year. \\
No fear. \\
Proceed without blame. \\
No shame. \\
Playing games with lives unborn. \\
No scorn. \\
Not torn between just and fucked up. \\
We've stuffed up. \\
Time to pick up. \\

It's coming up, beach boys. \\
It's gonna be a lot of fun. \\
The water's getting deeper \\
It's gonna drown everyone. \\

It's coming up, beach boys, \\
The weather's getting messed about. \\
You better bring boards down, \\
The waves are bigger than a house. \\

2.02 killer year. \\
The year that broke our broken \word{wheel}. \\
Is it enough that we're a speck of dust, \\
Speeding though a void of stuff? \\
We teeter on an axe edge. \\

Water signage, never read it. \\
How pathetic, coinciding. \\
Mystifying, sleep declining. \\
Too little, too late to contemplate. \\

Gotta make moves, cannot wait. \\
Need to recreate a clean slate. \\
Plan B, C and D. \\
However many needs it needs to be \\
To keep us free in ecstasy. \\
It's easier to swallow hiding in your burrow. \\
No need to wallow in your sorrows. \\

It's coming up, beach boys. \\
It's gonna be a lot of fun. \\
The water's getting deeper, \\
It's gonna drown everyone. \\

\song{Black Hot Soup}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Seething pot filled with hot liquid up to the top. \\
Spinning ball with molten core of iron ore. \\
What's it for? \\

Staring out in the dissonance. (Black hot soup.) \\
Black hot soup in the distance. (Black hot soup.) \\
Black hot soup engulfing me. (Black hot soup.) \\

Infinity is in a \word{dream} inside a dream. \\
You can achieve reality. \\
It gets better. (It gets better.) \\
It gets better. \\

Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin, \\
Floating above who you have been. \\
It gets better. \\
Gets better when you're with me. \\
(Better when you're with me.) \\
Here in my own reality with ya. \\
(Better when you're with me…) \\

Colossal fireball falling for an endless floor. \\
Warming wall is moving blind \\
To open shores and open minds. \\

Staring out in the dissonance. (Black hot soup.) \\
Black hot soup in the distance. (Black hot soup.) \\
Black hot soup engulfing me. (Black hot soup.) \\

Infinity is in a dream inside a dream. \\
You can achieve reality. \\
It gets better. (It gets better.) \\
It gets better. \\

Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin, \\
Floating above who you have been. \\
It gets better. \\
Gets better when you're with me. \\
(Better when you're with me.) \\
Here in my own reality with ya. \\
(Better when you're with me…) \\

Black hot soup. Black hot soup… \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Ya \word{love}. Ya love. Ya love. Ya love… \\

Ya love.

I can't wait to be underneath your spell. \\
I can't wait to spin the carousel. \\
I can't wait for your to sweep us up. \\
I just can't wait to feel your love. \\

Ya love. Ya love. Ya love. Ya love… \\

Your love is just a state of mind in mine. \\
Are we here? \\
Don't know. \\
But I don't mind. \\

I can't wait to go to some place with you. \\
I can't wait to go on adventures. \\
I can't wait for us to pick you up. \\
I just can't wait to feel your love. \\

Ya love. Ya love. Ya love. Ya love… \\

Your love is like a dream inside a dream. \\
Relax, close your eyes and be with me. \\

I can't wait to be underneath your spell. \\
I can't wait to spin the carousel. \\
I can't wait for your to sweep us up. \\
I just can't wait to feel your love. \\

\word{Butterfly} 3000. Butterfly 3000. \\

Hope that I am worthy of your love. \\
Hope I am deserving of your love. \\
Hope you can brush off the powers that be. \\
Hope I can empower femininity. \\

Hope I can teach you how to be mostly happy. \\
Hope you don't let the world crush you. \\
For it is beautiful out there \\
And there's a lot to see. \\

Hope I can teach you to see \\
The splendour of the moment. \\
Hope you can see the beauty \\
Within the grim world's ugly mess. \\

Butterfly 3000. Butterfly 3000… \\
