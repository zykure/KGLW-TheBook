\song{Fishing For Fishies}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. \\
I feel so sorry for fishies. \\
It seems like cruelty to me. \\
You ain't hungry: leave them be. \\

I don't want to be fishing for fish. \\
I just want to let them freely swim. \\
I don't want to be fishing for fish. \\
I just want to let them freely swim. \\

Oh your heart's a hook. \\
Ego tied in knots; baiting fate. \\
Don't do it; You ain't a \word{god}. \\
Don't hurt salmon, carp or cod. \\

Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. \\
I feel so sorry for fishies. \\
Don't matter to kiss and put back. \\
Poor fishies should be free. \\

I don't want to be fishing for fish. \\
I just want to let them freely swim. \\
I don't want to be fishing for fish. \\
I just want to let them freely swim. \\

Oh your heart's a hook. \\
Ego tied in knots; baiting fate. \\
Don't do it; You ain't a god. \\
Don't hurt salmon, carp or cod. \\

Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. \\
I feel so sorry for fishies. \\
Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. \\
I feel so sorry for fishies. \\

I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\
I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\
I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\
I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\

I've let them swum. I've let them swum. \\
I've let them swum. I've let them swum. \\

I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\
I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\
I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\
I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. \\

\song{Boogieman Sam}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Well up jumped the boogieman. \\
He ate mumma's babies and shot the policeman. \\
Went down to the nightclub, shocked all the patrons. \\
\word{Boogie}, boogie, boogie, boogieman with the room in his hand. \\
Causing mayhem 'cos he's the boogieman. \\
Causing mayhem 'cos he's the Boogieman Sam. \\
Boogieman Sam. \\

Well up jumped the boogieman. \\
He stole from a punter, the exact shoes he wanted, \\
To carve holes in the floorboards and dance like a demon. \\
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman with the room in his hand. \\
Causing mayhem 'cos he's the boogieman. \\
Arms are flailing 'cos he's the boogieman. \\
Doing damage 'cos he's the boogieman. \\
He's outlandish 'cos he's Boogieman Sam. \\
Boogieman Sam. \\

Yeah, yeah. \\
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. \\

\song{The Bird Song}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

To a bird, what's a plane? A shiny flying elephant. \\
To a tree, what's a house? Is that even relevant? \\

Does a bird know its name? To a bird, what's a plane? \\

To a cow, what is a car? It's a deadly predator. \\
To a bird, what's a plane? A shiny flying elephant. \\
To a tree, what's a house? Can it think at all? \\

Does a bird know its name? To a bird, what's a plane? \\

To a cloud, what is a breeze? It's a predetermined sneeze. \\
To a seal, what is real? Surely more than it can feel. \\
To a bird, what's a plane? A shiny flying elephant. \\
To a tree, what's a house? Is that even relevant? \\

Does a bird know its name? To a bird, what's a plane? \\

To a bird, what's a plane? \\

\song{Plastic Boogie}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\

Fuck all of that plastic wrapped up in my dinner. \\
It's not fantastic. \\
It's gonna come and kill us. \\
It's gonna be massive. \\
It's gonna be brutal. \\
Death will come from plastic. \\
Death will come from people. \\

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\

Fuck all of those plastic particles in the ocean. \\
It's like a vendetta against our Mother Nature.

The way we wrap it. \\
The way we wrap it is wrong. \\
We wrap it. \\
Plastic \word{boogie}. \\
We wrap it. \\
The way we wrap it. \\
The way we wrap it. \\

Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie. \\

The way we wrap it. \\
The way we wrap it is wrong. \\
We wrap it. \\
Plastic boogie. \\
We wrap it. \\The way we wrap it. \\
The way we wrap it. \\

Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie. \\
Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie. \\

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. \\

Fuck all of that plastic. \\
Fuck all of that plastic. \\
Fuck all of that plastic. \\
Fuck all of that plastic. \\

\song{The Cruel Millennial}

\writtenby{Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie}

Underestimated technology. \\
I'm addicted to tablet screens. \\
No escaping battleground PUBG. \\
Computer games ain't for me. \\
Can't relate face to face with modern day youth. \\
Outdated; the post millennial will get you. \\
I was born in the echo boom, \\
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial. \\
I was only born in '92, \\
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial. \\

The cruel millennial. \\

White dog shit; not on my nature strip. \\
Calcium bone conspiracist. \\
Berenstein Bears read to as kids. \\
It's a glitch in the matrix. \\
Can't relate face to face with modern day youth. \\
Outdated; the post millennial will get you. \\
I was born in the echo boom, \\
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial. \\

The cruel millennial. \\
The cruel millennial. \\
The cruel millennial. \\
The cruel millennial. \\

\song{Real's Not Real}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

What in the world is going on? \\
That pretty picture's looking wrong. \\
If happy is all you wanna be, then \\
I can see that the painting ain't painted with love. \\
What in the world is going on here? \\
Your past is built upon your fear. \\
And happy is what you'll never be. \\
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will. \\

Your real's not real. \\
Your real's not real. \\

What in the world is going on? \\
Can't we all just get along? \\
Our candy is melting in the sun. \\
Can anyone be a martyr from hereafter? \\
What in the world is going on now? \\
Your farm is full of sacred cow. \\
And happy is what you'll never be. \\
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will. \\

Your real's not real. \\
Your real's not real.  \\

\song{This Thing}

\writtenby{Walker/Mackenzie}

Well, I fake a lot of symptoms \\
To be a different person. \\
I try to listen, I try to be primed \\
For a reason to go back to sleep. \\
That's not to say there's no relief. \\
I like it when it happens; you don't. \\
You're happy? \\
When you show it; I won't. \\
The cycle keeps repeating. \\
I can't escape the rip. \\
There's no stopping what this is. \\

Back in the day your style was impressive, infectious, stress-less. \\
Disposition had it all, nothing but rapport. \\
Full of what you're empty of. \\
I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets that reek of suspicious happenings. \\
'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick. \\
There's no stopping what this is. \\

This thing we left outside is waterlogged. \\
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard. \\
This thing we left outside is waterlogged and \\
All that I know is one of us has to wring it out. \\
This thing we left outside is waterlogged. \\
I've thought about nothing but this. \\
I won't escape the rip. \\

\song{Acarine}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

I am the honeybee. \\
Drink the blood of the tree. \\
I can't breathe, I can't see. \\
Evil being; confusing. \\

Buried deep inside of me: Acarine. \\
Buried deep inside of me: Acarine. \\

Little mite; so much spite. \\
Multiply, ruin life. \\
I can't fly. \\
I can't cry. \\
Acarine; make me die. \\

Buried deep inside of me. \\
Buried deep inside of me. \\
Buried deep inside of me: Acarine. \\

Acarine. \\
Conduct larynx cesarean. \\
Excise low life. \\
Acarine. \\

\song{Cyboogie}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Cyboogie, \word{boogie}, boogie. \\
Cyboogie. \\

Cyboogie: A hunk of grey matt. \\
Multitude cells in his metallic dome. \\
Brine fluid floating within, \\
Flows between nodes in his cognisance home. \\
Cyboogie: Augmented senses. \\
Scholarship vogue called for celebration. \\
But was it a consciousness can? \\
Bouncy ball thoughts in his celebration. \\

Cyboogie. Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie… \\
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. \\
Cyboogie. \\

Cyboogie's heart is a mess. \\
Cables in knots in his cavity chest. \\
Cyboogie's feeling depressed. \\
Need to de-bug and run over the tests. \\
Cyboogie's ticker ain't flesh. \\
Pistons and pumps under graphene lattice. \\
No people to service the mess \\
When he breaks down in spiritual stress. \\

Cyboogie. Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie… \\
Cyboogie. \\
Boogie, boogie. \\
Cyboogie \\

Cyboogie: Lump in his throat. \\
Palpitations and nausea ensue. \\
Cyboogie's chorophobia; \\
terminal error vascular tissue. \\
So Cyboogie's fishing for fishies. \\
Red-bellied trout in a binary brook. \\
How is it that he is depressed? \\
The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook. \\

Cyboogie. \\
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie… \\
Cyboogie. \\
