This e-book collects all lyrics from the Australian band \emph{King Gizzard \& the Lizard Wizard}. \\
I started this project in June 2025 because I wanted to read Gizz lyrics on my e-book reader while listening to their music.
The included songs are grouped by album, and albums are added in chronological order (oldest first.) \\
There is also a song index at the end of the document that lists all songs in alphabetical order regardless of album,
and a word index that references selected words that are reoccuring throughout the lyrics. \\[5mm]
