\song{The Land Before Timeland}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Cavanagh/Craig/Kenny-Smith/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

It's good to be back. \\
Re-railed, back on track. \\
Change the clock through sleight of hand. \\
The \word{river} has been spanned. \\
Behold: the land before Timeland. \\

Teleportality, teleport you and me \\
From possibility to actuality. \\
Denim laminated, past illuminated. \\
Evil stimulated, future pixelated. \\

Laminated denim. \\

Laminated denim. \\
\word{Rattlesnake} venom. \\
\word{Serpent}-man demon. \\
Laminated denim. \\
Hide-out in the plenum \\
Where they can't get us. \\
Warmer air can benumb. \\
Laminated denim. \\

Laminated denim. \\
The forces came to hem in. \\
They'll get in if we let them. \\
Laminated denim. \\
Sunrise gameplan. \\
\word{Sky} like a lemon. \\
In \word{death} I'll be \\
A free man or woman. \\
Laminated denim. \\

It's good to be back. \\
Re-railed, back on track. \\
Change the clock through sleight of hand. \\
The river has been spanned. \\
Behold: the land before Timeland. \\

Teleportality, teleport you and me \\
From possibility to actuality. \\
Denim laminated, past illuminated. \\
Evil stimulated, future pixelated. \\

Laminated denim. \\

Laminated denim. \\
Satanic journeyman. \\
Seven metre wingspan. \\
Laminated denim. \\
Fire-winds are blowing. \\
Hourglass is going. \\
Long nights are impending. \\
Laminated denim. \\

It's good to be back. \\
Re-railed, back on track. \\
Change the clock through sleight of hand. \\
The river has been spanned. \\
Behold: the land before Timeland. \\

\song{Hypertension}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Cavanagh/Craig/Kenny-Smith/Walker}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Like a red herring, laminated denim. \\
A note outside the scale from beyond the pale. \\
Unwitting host, inside-out ghost. \\
Harbinger of changes, destiny exchanges. \\

Time slows, eyes close. \\
In crimson tubes the pressure grows. \\
Sticky red \word{death}, life theft. \\
\word{Hypertension} is all that's left. \\

Golden hour turns to pink vein wine light. \\
\word[satan]{Satan's} son, \\
Foul one, demon of time. \\
Bat wing membrane \\
Eclipsed the \word{Sun} for fun. \\

Generation ferry, laminated denim. \\
Rotate anti-clockwise and see through backward facing eyes. \\
Feel its allure, history jeweller. \\
Stumbled on its ladder and eaten by its chasm. \\

Then your mind slows, stress grows. \\
In crimson tubes the pressure grows. \\
Sticky red death, life theft. \\
Hypertension is all that's left. \\

Who am I if not the \word[canary in coal mine]{canary in the coal mine}? \\
I won't be back. \\
I slipped and fell into its lap, \\
Innards boil inside my tracts. \\

I caught that hypertension in another dimension. \\
Inside my time invention, I've laminated denimâ€¦ \\
