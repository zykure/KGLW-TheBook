\song[Ants \textamp{} Bats]{Ants \& Bats}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Ants and bats. \\
Dusts and pulls. \\
Slalom here. \\
Stay at home. \\

A dirty bear. \\
Is all I need. \\
His tired eyes. \\
Will help me sleep. \\

\song{Sleep}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

1, 2, 3, 4! \\

I got up early. \\
And you've got me up too. \\
And you pull me under. \\
And you say ``My leg''. \\
But I don't wanna. \\
Go back to sleep again. \\
But I dont' wanna. \\
Stay like this for 5 more minutes. \\

And you always sleep. \\
Before the day goes. \\
It's time to wake up. \\

Green grass, won't last. \\
Sky blue, me too. \\

Lie in the whirl. \\
Makes you hurt. \\
Lie in the sky. \\
Makes you high. \\

Going down now. \\
To the beach now. \\
You look fine, yeah. \\
Like a beach, yeah. \\

\song{Trench Foot}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Life is cool. \\
Then you die. \\
Stick a needle. \\
In your eye. \\
Cars are fun. \\
Then you crash. \\
Slit your wrists. \\
Slash your neck. \\
