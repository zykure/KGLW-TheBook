\song{Mycelium}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig/Harwood/Cavanagh]}

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium… \\

I ain't a bald primate. \\
That tongue does not relate. \\
Man is done. \\
The ape is dead. \\
Lungs of the planet on a golden thread. \\
I ain't debating. \\
I'm a mushroom, ok. \\
I spread like \word{lava}. \\
Rise like bread. \\
Currency of decay. \\
Amongst my kin, I extend acidic salutations. \\
Exhale the dust of seasons. \\
Inhale the breath of civilisations. \\
I grip with devil's fingers and stroke the green curtain. \\
We, the thoughtful element. \\
Dumb rock. \\
Unthinking ocean. \\
Network of the wood. \\
Tannin of the evening. \\
Synapse of the bush. \\
I disappear amongst my kin. \\

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium… \\

I ain't a bald primate. \\
That tongue does not relate in any way. \\
Man is done. \\
The ape is dead. \\
Lungs of the planet on a golden thread. \\
And I ain't debating now. \\
I'm a mushroom, ok. \\
I spread like lava. \\
Rise like bread. \\
Paralysed agaric fungus. \\

Fed back into the, the bourgeoisie. \\
What the hell is happening to me? \\

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium… \\

Paralysed agaric fungus. \\
Toadstool dome grown humongous. \\
Stomach knots and purple skin. \\
Mirrored faces doubling. \\
Bursting beams of hopping rabbits. \\
Organs bleed with sucking maggots. \\
Metallic teeth. \\
Ancient Goblet. \\
Increase the dosage with a droplet. \\
Blackened gold beneath the surface. \\
Dark horse undermining and amorphous. \\
Fed back into the bourgeoisie. \\
What the hell is happening to me? \\
Spore filled breath. \\
I'll spread myself over the forest floor and infest the elk. \\
Feasting on decay and sprouting anew. \\
I'll make my biome part of mycelium. \\

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium… \\

\song{Ice V}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig/Harwood/Cavanagh]}

Ice V. Ice V. Ice V… \\

Ganymede princess with the tongue of death. \\
She smells what the wind says with the \word{lava} forked pincers. \\
Ganymede princess with a lungless chest. \\
With her tongue's forked pincers she smells what the people says. \\

Ice V. Ice V. Ice V… \\

Monoclinic. \\
Crystalline. \\
Spears of death shoot down the line. \\
Autocratic and quantised. \\
Land mine meteorite. \\
Lost in transit. \\
Obliteration. \\
Disconnected correlations. \\
Lucky 7. \\
Ace of spades. \\
Double down. \\
Checkmate. \\

Ice V. Ice V. Ice V… \\

Ain't getting out of here alive. \\
Ice V has arrived. \\

Pimple pus. \\
Crop circle pit. \\
Oozing out of crevices. \\
Sentient toadstool throne. \\
Crooked sceptre. \\
Alien bone. \\
Frosted pistol. \\
Loaded spite. \\
Shooting rays of frozen light. \\
Feel the doom of flashing flood. \\
Crimson clouds are raining blood. \\

Will we survive Ice V? \\

Ice V. Ice V. Ice V… \\

Queen of ice. \\
Suffice to say. \\
Engulfing all in crystal dismay. \\
Freezing whims as the sun dims. \\
The pressure tearing limb from limb. \\
\word[earth]{Earth-born} cities stripped away. \\
As the ice queen hypnotically sways. \\
Queen of ice. \\
Suffice to say. \\
Engulfing all in crystal dismay. \\

Ice V. Ice V. Ice V… \\

Ain't getting out of here alive. \\
Ice V has arrived. \\

\song{Magma}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig/Cavanagh/Harwood]}

Magma. \\
Fire bagwan. \\
The all, the one and the none. \\
Lifts rock. \\
Makes stuff. \\
The sleeping hawk. \\
The ticking clock. \\
Hair of child. \\
Skin of bone. \\
Gift of flesh. \\
Exchanged for a burn. \\
I'm a drill. \\
I drown the \word{Earth}. \\
Tectonic romance. \\
Infinite rebirth. \\

Magma. \\
Essence oozing. \\
Molten rock. \\
Moving fluorescence. \\
Melting all within its presence. \\
Forever creeping luminescence. \\
Destroying to invent. \\
Magma god ever present. \\
I live in debt. \\
I bathe in glow. \\
Subterranean web. \\
Infest the soul. \\
Flying arcs come bearing gifts. \\
Praise the return of G.I. Joe. \\
Brewing beneath. \\
The magma shifts. \\
Heavenly bird. \\
Luscious cargo. \\
Digging deep. \\
Burying gifts for the molten god that sits beneath our feet. \\
Great abyss. \\
Offerings burn in the pit. \\
We console. \\
Reminisce for the molten god that sits. \\
He'll accept those that commit if we dance in the shit. \\

Magma. \\
Subterranean tsar. \\
The scimitar and the neutron star. \\
Makes from ether. \\
Basalt weaver. \\
Obsidian cleaver. \\
Make believer. \\

A rumble. \\
A smile. \\
A red tongue. \\
Oesophagus. \\
A greeting. \\
A portal. \\
Auto-cremate. \\
Immortal. \\

\song{Lava}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig/Harwood/Cavanagh]}

Death. \\
Smells like boiled eggs. \\
Death. \\
A hot stove glowing red. \\
\word{Lava}. \\
Sticky like peanut butter. \\
Lava. \\
The ultimate stonecutter. \\

Anointed in the bubbling lake. \\
Charring lungs asphyxiate. \\
Unlike quicksand it's instant. \\
Devours whole. \\
No longer existent. \\
Pumice rain engulfs. \\
A mushroom cloud brings tumult. \\
Remains are shells. \\
Rain won't quell. \\
\word{Earth} is hell. \\

Burning flesh and melting skin. \\
I submit to the molten king. \\
The messiah deep below. \\
Give my essence to the afterglow. \\
There I'll speak to the magma lord. \\
And bathe in the warmth of the red fjord. \\
Past this life of green meadows. \\
Lava afterlife in charred plateaus. \\

The volcano is death. \\
The lava is death. \\
Death is life. \\
The lava is life. \\

The \word{serpent} is death. \\
The serpent is death. \\
The serpent is life. \\
The serpent is life. \\

The head is death. \\
The tail is death. \\
The head is life. \\
The tail is life. \\

The volcano is death. \\
The lava is death. \\
Death is life. \\
The lava is life. \\

The volcano is death. \\
Death. \\
Lava. \\
Death. \\

\song{Hell's Itch}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig/Cavanagh/Harwood]}

Flick the switch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Derma-glitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Bewitched. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Perpetual twitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\

Why, why, why when my nail glides through my epidermis does it feel so joyous? \\
The deeper the cut. \\
The thicker the blood. \\
Subcutaneous fat feels good like that. \\
Dancing beneath my wafer-thin crust. \\
Teasing me. \\
Taunting me. \\
My unquenchable lust. \\
If I only could locate this bug. \\
Oozing under like a slug. \\
I'd slice my skin to get within. \\
Lacerate my own linchpin. \\
Nominate my next of kin. \\
Destroy myself with no chagrin. \\
Find the source of this deep remorse. \\
Buried deep inside me like a sunken horse. \\
Rooted below in the innermost abyss is a fathomless unscratchable itch. \\

Shed my skin if need be to suppress the itch for it would fill me with glee. \\
Whatever is this persistent yearn to rip off my skin and stop the burn? \\
Crawling tender temptations. \\
Catacombs beneath the layers of hatching eggs. \\
Thunder threads. \\
Claws enthralled in pitted keratosis. \\
Lacerations peeling paper-thin. \\
Barbecue skin. \\
Deeper burying. \\

Flick the switch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Derma-glitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Bewitched. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Perpetual twitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Rising pitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Latent witch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Grisly stitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
The old adage: Pain is easier to endure than an itch. \\

Shed my skin if it need be. \\
To suppress the itch would fill me with glee. \\
Whatever is this persistent yearning to rip off my skin and stop the burning. \\
Crawling tender temptations. \\
Catacombs beneath the layers of hatching eggs. \\
Thunder threads. \\
Claws enthralled in pitted keratosis. \\
Lacerations peeling paper-thin. \\
Barbecue skin. \\
Deeper burying. \\

Flick the switch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Derma-glitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Bewitched. \\
Hell's itch. \\
Perpetual twitch. \\
Hell's itch. \\

Let the sun burn. \\
Oh, my cells gurn. \\
When the skin drips I sing the hell's itch. \\
Deep in the compost. \\
Believe that the worm can still see the light. \\
Sing the hell's itch. \\
I sleep with the \word{rat} who's kiss has set me free. \\
Oh, I sing. \\
Oh, I sing the hell's itch. \\
Prick the ceramic. \\
Bodily condom be gone. \\
Oh, baby please be gone. \\
The breeze on my flesh feels so fuckin' good. \\
Look at me now, Helen. \\
Yeah, I'm finally red. \\
Yeah, I'm finally red. \\

Why, why, why when my nail glides through my epidermis does it feel so joyous? \\
The deeper the cut. \\
The thicker the blood. \\
Subcutaneous fat hurts good like that. \\
Dancing beneath my wafer-thin crust. \\
Teasing me. \\
Taunting me. \\
My unquenchable lust. \\
If only I could locate this bug. \\
Oozing under like a slug. \\
I'd slice my skin to get within. \\
Lacerate my own linchpin. \\
Nominate my next of kin. \\

Find the source of this deep remorse. \\
Buried deep inside me like a sunken horse. \\
Rooted below in the innermost abyss is a fathomless unscratchable itch. \\

\song{Iron Lung}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker/Craig/Harwood/Cavanagh]}

Hey, oh. \\
I'm in jail. \\
Body failed. \\
Now it's me and my iron lung. \\
Wrapped in iron. \\
Deathless purgatory. \\
Negative pressure. \\
Airless breath. \\
Wrapped in iron. \\
Breathless purgatory. \\
Positive pressure. \\
Airless death. \\

It's a different kind of cuttlefish. \\
Swing and a miss. \\
Dancing with my eyes and lips. \\
Can't move my hips. \\
Keep my mind distracted from the swish-swish. \\
Staying sane and positive. \\
Can't crumble like a biscuit. \\

Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung… \\

Space shuttle. \\
Snail shell. \\
Merry go round. \\
Conveyor belt. \\
The army tank ventilator. \\
Mechanical bull respirator. \\
Metallic cocoon boredom. \\
Bionic boy. \\
Pump my organs. \\
Centre gravity. \\
Planet me. \\
Gimme the mushrooms. \\
Time to leave. \\

Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung… \\

Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\
Neck paralysis. \\
Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\

Scared precarious. \\
Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\
Neck paralysis. \\
Congestion in my chest. \\
Pins and needles like a voodoo evil. \\
Got my doctor baffled. \\
Every breath is an uphill battle. \\
Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\
Neck paralysis. \\
Congestion in my chest. \\

Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\
Neck paralysis. \\
Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\
Scared precarious. \\
Frog breath. \\
Steam tent. \\
Neck paralysis. \\
Sedated death. \\

Hey, oh. \\
The ship sailed. \\
Train derailed. \\
Now it's me and my iron lung. \\
Wrapped in iron. \\
Deathless purgatory. \\
Negative pressure. \\
Airless breath. \\
Wrapped in iron. \\
Breathless purgatory. \\
Positive pressure. \\
Airless death. \\

It's a different kind of cuttlefish. \\
Swing and a miss. \\
Dancing with my eyes and lips. \\
Can't move my hips. \\
Gotta keep my mind distracted from the swish-swish. \\
I'm staying sane and positive. \\
Can't crumble like a biscuit. \\

Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung… \\

Cylindrical prison. \\
Newly arisen. \\
Chained to a giant paper weight. \\
Pain abates yet darkness permeates. \\
Wallows my toes. \\
Burdens my chest. \\
My brain is pressed with an iron chest. \\

Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung… \\

\song{Gliese 710}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Craig/Harwood/Cavanagh]}

Melt the ice. \\
Reheat the dead. \\
Terraform the planet. \\
Compress the lungs. \\
Eat the mushroom. \\
Cool the \word{lava}. \\
Watch the new star dance upon the night sky. \\
Fly my pretty silver lining. \\
Wishful thinking. \\
Strike defiant. \\
Send your prayers for Gliese 710. \\
Locked and loaded. \\
Death descends. \\

Alien figures stumble sickly as their planet bakes. \\
Constellations crumble quickly. \\
On the horizon; cosmic waves. \\
Shooting stars rain upon a distant planet. \\
Hadron colliding. \\
Forked lightning. \\
Melting the cake's icing. \\

Fragmentation. \\
New permutations. \\
Needlepoint mutilations. \\
Stick the fork in the powerpoint to be perturbed by revelations. \\

Freeze the water. \\
Kill the living. \\
Bake the planet. \\
Suffocate the lungs. \\
Grow the mushroom. \\
Feed the volcano. \\
Watch the new star dance upon the night sky. \\

Boil the water. \\
Bury the dead. \\
Destroy the planet. \\
Collapse the lungs. \\
Disintegrate the mushroom. \\
Join the volcano. \\
Be a cloud of gas upon the night sky. \\
