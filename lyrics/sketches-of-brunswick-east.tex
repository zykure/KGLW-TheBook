\song{Countdown}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Brettin/Cavanagh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Countdown. \\
D-Day. \\
I don't want to be late for countdown. \\
Distress. \\
I don't want to make a mess. \\

When it all falls away, clothes start to fray. \\
Buildings decay, rabble remains \\
Where they were green. \\
Sterility, \word{humanity}. \\
Staring at me. \\

Countdown. \\
D-Day. \\
I don't want to be late for countdown. \\
De-stress. \\
I don't want to make a mess. \\

When it all falls away, clouds start to fray. \\
Buildings decay, rabble remains \\
Where they were green. \\
Sterility, humanity. \\
Staring at me. \\

When it all falls away, clouds start to fray. \\
Buildings decay, rabble remains \\
Where they were green. \\
Sterility, humanity. \\
Staring at me. \\

Countdown. Countdown… \\

\song{Tezeta}

\writtenby{Walker}

\vocalsby{Han-Tyumi \& Joey Walker}

\word{Tezeta}, tezeta. \\
Tezeta, tezeta. \\
Remember, remember. \\
Tezeta, tezeta. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

If I've been insane \\
My whole \word{life}, well, now I've changed \\
Into something that sees. \\
I love the feeling. \\
Shape shifting ceiling. \\
My mental projection is pink. \\

\vocalsby{Han-Tyumi \& Joey Walker}

``Come here girl.'' \\
``Who are you?'' \\
``I am true perspective.'' \\

Tezeta, tezeta. \\
Tezeta, tezeta. \\
Nostalgia, nostalgia. \\
Tezeta, tezeta. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Everything that lives and \word[die]{dis} \\
Is a hologram. \\
Nothing is as real as that. \\

\vocalsby{Han-Tyumi \& Joey Walker}

``Come here boy.'' \\
``Are you \word{God}?'' \\
``I am that which I am.'' \\

``Do you remember now?'' \\
``What? (Yes, I do!)'' \\
``This, my \word{altered plan}.'' \\

\song{The Spider and Me}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Brettin}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Let me just introduce you to my friend. \\
Under the tree, spider and me. \\
All day we'll sit about, giggling free. \\
Under the tree, spider and me. \\

Spider and me… \\

Laze in the afternoon sun, \\
Gazing at each other's beauty. \\
The huntsman's heart forever beats. \\
Our union is forever. \\

\word{Love} for my spider is nothing stranger \\
Than my admiring love of nature. \\
Am I a hippie if I have this love? \\
We are the same stuff from the same cloth. \\

Spider and me… \\

Laze in the afternoon sun, \\
Gazing at each other's beauty. \\
The huntsman's heart forever beats. \\
Our union is forever. \\

Let me just introduce you to my friend. \\
Under the tree, spider and me. \\

\song{Dusk To Dawn On Lygon Street}

\writtenby{Craig/Mackenzie/Brettin}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the \word{Earth}. \\
Then the \word{Moon} smiles at the \word[sun]{Sun's} birth. \\
Faceless night cowers underneath \\
The ever-changing moonlit \word{sky}. \\
Can you believe the way night falls away \\
As the sun starts a new day? \\

Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye. \\
Dusk greets the horizon as day fades. \\
Black lines bend round a cityscape \\
While trailing off in the sunset's wake. \\
I can foresee that dawn will bring the light \\
As the sun gives way to night. \\

\song{The Book}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

\word{God} gave me a sign, \\
He put it in my glass of wine. \\
A great theophany, \\
He told me every sinner had to \word{die}. \\
So I set up my sign and tell the passers-by: \\
We are a sacrifice. \\
Like it or not \\
I live by the book. \\

These aren't fables between pages. \\
My book's ageless and it's page-less. \\

The book… \\

God gave me a \word{knife} \\
And wrote \word{seppuku} underlined. \\
Godly suicide, \\
He told me everyone will die. \\
So judge me by the page but not by my cover. \\
You'll learn more with age. \\
Like it or not \\
I live by the book. \\

These aren't fables between pages. \\
My book's ageless and it's page-less. \\

The book… \\

These aren't fables between pages. \\
My book's ageless and it's page-less. \\

The book… \\

\song{You Can Be Your Silhouette}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

When you make time \\
To \word{clear the cobwebs} off your mind \\
You may find yourself unwind. \\
When all the ticking stops dead, \\
You may find more time instead \\
And you can be your silhouette. \\

When you just stop \\
And take a look around your shop \\
You may feel your blues all drop. \\
You can't sell your glum to me, \\
But I can help you till you see \\
That you can be your silhouette. \\

It may be dark, \\
It may be shadowy and stark. \\
But don't be scared of what you've met. \\
Your dance with it is no threat, \\
In fact it is an asset. \\
You can be your silhouette. \\
