\song{The Dripping Tap}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith]}

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the suits in charge of the world \\
and our future's hanging on by a thread with our heads in the sand \\
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the gods up above us \\
Big sky country \\
That we never hear from in these time of our dying needs \\

A familiar sound ignored \\
The compartmentalised thoughts \\
In that back corner of the drawer \\
That drip, drip on the floor \\

Don't get drowned \\
Heed that sound \\

Left the tap on \\
Swampin' out of the sink \\
Left the tap on \\
Agua flowin' in \\
Left the tap on \\
Blankets over my skin \\
Left the tap on \\
Wish I learned how to swim \\

Left the tap on \\
Swampin' out of the sink \\
Left the tap on \\
Agua flowin' in \\
Left the tap on \\
Blankets over my skin \\
Left the tap on \\
Wish I learned how to swim \\

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the suits in charge of the world \\
And our future's hanging on by a thread with our heads in the sand \\

Drip, drip from the tap don't slip \\
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip \\

Everybody's on the same orbit \\
When they get old and moronic \\
Get complacent and get bored \\
That drip, drip on the floor \\

Don't get drowned \\
Heed that sound \\

Left the tap on \\
Swampin' out of the sink \\
Left the tap on \\
Agua flowin' in \\
Left the tap on \\
Blankets over my skin \\
Left the tap on \\
Wish I learned how to swim \\

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the suits in charge of the world \\
And our future's hanging on by a thread with our heads in the sand \\
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the gods up above us \\
Big sky country \\
That we never hear from in these time of our dying needs \\

\song{Magenta Mountain}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Kenny-Smith]}

Look past the dying trees, beyond waterless seas \\
Atop the horizon, adjacent to the sun \\
Give my word that it's there -- magenta mountain \\

What do you mean, you can't see it? \\
My life must be a dream -- a living fantasy \\
Disappeared in hot air -- magenta mountain \\

I don't believe you \\
Your eyes deceive you \\
Better check yourself in \\
The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream \\
Can't you see you've gone insane? \\

I packed my bags and my swag for the road \\
Followed the bows of the ancient railroads \\
Need to rendezvous where clouds can't misconstrue \\
I'm certain it is real -- magenta mountain \\

You will say I'm crazy \\
I will go on my way 'cos it's what I need \\
I'd cross a thousand seas just to prove I'm not mad \\
Magenta mountain \\

Magenta mountain \\

It's you again \\
Yeah \\
I thought I saw a statue blink and a bird with no head \\
Land on a golden thread \\
I rub my eyes \\
What am I saying? \\
There's nothing there \\

Magenta mountain \\
Magenta mountain \\
It's my sanctuary, that I wanna be chasing every chance I get \\
Don't wanna be left \\
Never not making it there \\

What was confusing is now seducing \\
Imagination is a powerful thing \\
I see a flash of purple stone closing in \\

Magenta mountain \\
Magenta mountain \\
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get \\
Don't wanna be left \\
Never not making it there \\

I am tectonic \\
I am megalithic \\
My spirit runs mauve \\
I am the mountain of which you dream \\
I see you now behind the lens looking back at me \\

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo… \\
We fell through a dream across clouds of glue \\
Anamnesis crashing through \\

Magenta mountain \\
Magenta mountain \\
Magenta mountain \\
Magenta mountain \\

\song{Kepler-22b}

\note{[Written By: Craig/Mackenzie/McAll]}

Nerdy kid at school with astral thoughts \\
Wanted to be an astronaut so I could be alone in space \\

Get away \\
Dreamt of Kepler-22b \\
That's the place for me \\

Didn't get the grades to be a NASA astronaut \\
Couldn't knuckle down or focus on my schoolwork \\
I became a ghetto engineer making shit out of glass to refract the light from distant stars \\
Then I built a telescope \\
So big \\
Pointed it at Kepler-22b \\
That's the place for me \\

Good for ya \\
Obsession is good for ya \\
Good for ya \\
Obsession is good for ya \\

Can you guess the first thing I seen on Kepler-22
A telescope pointing back at me \\
On Kepler-22b \\
A telescope pointing back at me \\
On Kepler-22b \\
A telescope pointing back at me \\

Good for ya \\
Obsession is good for ya \\
Good for ya \\
Obsession is good for ya \\
Good for ya \\
Obsession is good for ya \\
Good for ya \\
Obsession is good for ya \\

\song{Ambergris}

\note{[Written By: Walker]}

Breathing heavy candles \\
Cut a face from a smile \\
Preserve the torch; it's imperative \\
So douse some fuel on the fire \\

Some dogs get whale eye \\
Got a nose for that sea spice \\
I wish that I had strength like that \\
Dominion over my chemistry \\

Didn't you know? \\
The camel's out of water \\
The dog sweat on the seat \\
Had me slippin' like a creep \\

Haven't you heard? \\
They worked out double standards \\
Apply only to me \\
Finally, it's working \\
Ambergris \\

Sculpting confidence with chimney smoke \\
Record my weight in kidney stones \\
CFCs gnaw at my intellect \\
Colour coding my lymph nodes \\

Anthropomorphise everything \\
Use my blowhole like a microphone \\
Every night I dream that you will see \\
The harpoon that I've grown to need \\

Apropos, \\
The camel's out of water \\
The dog sweat on the seat \\
Had me slippin' like a creep \\

Ergo, \\
I worked out double standards \\
Apply only to me \\
Finally, it's working \\
Ambergris \\

\song{Sadie Sorceress}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Walker/Kenny-Smith/Mason/Reed]}

Who's this Sadie Sorceress? \\

Let me tell you bout this 80s lady named Sadie \\
She's wild like a witch \\
She's more fly than Quidditch \\
Smoking winnies and drinking tinnies and Glenfiddich \\
She's a roller blader skating \\
Masquerading \\
Squabble and gobble \\
Eats blood and trouble \\
Meddles in the metal in it \\
She flies a handbag freak flag \\
\word{Dragon} scale knapsack \\
Fur, a pelt of mastodon \\
Brings it on as carry on \\
Sharp like parmesan \\
Living non-partisan \\
Leviathan cardigan \\
Elegant artisan \\
Concealing her identity as an evil entity \\
Anti-sanctity in a vastity quantity \\
Nightshade bringing death commander \\
Have a gander -- oleander \\
Poisonous like buttercups \\
She's dressing up to fuck shit up \\

Hello love \\
How are ya? \\

Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress \\
Snapping necks with her broomstick getting tortuous \\

The pagan shaman sorceress \\
Cackling \\
Bat shit \\
Non-conformist \\
Moles on her nose so enormous \\
The public, they can't ignore it \\
Pitchforks banging on her door \\
They wanna throw her overboard to see if she floats or sinks into the floor \\
There she goes bobbing on the surface as the peasants and servants start to yell "hooray, sell her to the circus" \\
But she's had enough of playing it down and playing it dumb \\
She's dropping bombs on this human scum \\
Ain't no thing as collateral damage in this supernatural planet with a habit of getting savage \\
Making sacrifices for the paradise of perdition, the trials and tribulations for the forbidden religion \\

Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress \\
Snapping necks with her broomstick getting tortuous \\

The most dangerous, debaucherous, Sadie sorceress \\

\song{Evilest Man}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

Evilest man \\

I have no choice but to ignore the voices in the newspaper \\
I feel so sad from what I see \\
Misinformation around me \\

I have no faith in what I read \\
The tabloids and the TV screen \\
I see it just as clear as the high definition images \\

Don't wanna scare inaction into you, but what you read you will turn into \\
Pull up your socks or become a fox \\
Do you wanna be just like the evilest man? \\
Murdochian \\

How very long must his arms be to span the distance he can reach? \\
To make all our four corners square \\
We're in his conservative lair \\
I wonder if he knows this song… \\
Probably read it before it was done \\
He probably hacked my phone \\
I'll change the locks when I get home \\

\song{The Garden Goblin}

\note{[Written By: Craig/Mackenzie]}

The garden goblin \\

Isn't this the place for you \\
Here in the garden we're safe for now \\
Behind the tree the garden goblin's looking at me \\
At me \\
At me \\

What's that expression upon his face? \\
Doesn't it look like contempt \\
Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you \\

Grow \\

What does he want us to comprehend? \\
This garden was never his place \\
Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you \\

Grow \\

The garden goblin \\
What doesn't he want the world to know? \\
The garden goblin \\
Why doesn't he want to let it grow? \\
The garden goblin \\
What doesn't he want the world to know? \\
The garden goblin \\
Why doesn't he want to let it grow? \\
The garden goblin \\
Grow. Grow. Grow \\
The garden goblin \\
Grow. Grow. Grow \\

Couldn't he be friendly like the gnome \\
Wipe that smirk right off his face \\
Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you \\

Isn't this the place for you \\
Here in the garden we're safe for now \\
Behind the tree the garden goblin's looking at me \\
At me \\
At me \\

\note{[Written By: Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker/Cavanagh]}

Go on then, blame it on the weather \\
Go on then, blame it on the weather \\
Go on then, blame it on the weather… \\

Gloomy days make you see the downside \\
Like an arrow straight through the bullseye \\
K-hole, spiral through space and time \\
Stimuli, numb your mind \\

Go on then, blame it on the weather \\
Go on then, blame it on the weather \\
Go on then, blame it on the weather… \\

Even if you like pain, life ain't a sadist's game \\
The devil ain't your friend -- he's savage \\
That man on the corner of the street pulled the rug from under your feet \\
You're flying now so you'd better stick the landing otherwise you ain't got a leg to stay standing \\
Standing on \\

Stay standing \\
Standing on \\
Stay standing \\
Standing on \\
Stay standing \\
All alone \\
Oh no \\

Go on then, blame it on the weather \\
Go on then, blame it on the weather \\
Go on then, blame it on the weather… \\

\song{Persistence}

\note{[Written By: Craig/Mackenzie]}

Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
I'm an automatic transmission \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
I hold the pole position \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Yeah I go the distance \\

No want for gas -- I run on love \\
So cut the brakes \\
There's no end of the road \\
Unfading highway \\
Pass no cars on the way \\
So set to cruise \\
Let's get away \\

Let's drive \\
Drive, drive, drive \\
Let's drive \\
Drive, drive, drive, drive \\

Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
I'm an automatic transmission \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
I hold the pole position \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Yeah I go the distance \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Yeah I go the distance \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Yeah I go the distance \\

Yeh I go the distance \\
Yeh I go the distance \\
Yeh I go the distance \\

I think I went too fast \\
You did \\
I think the car might crash \\
It will \\
I'll have to pull out the wings and feel the lift underfoot \\
I'm shaking with fear \\
Such a crazy idea \\
Better give it a try \\
See if this car can fly \\

Let's fly \\
Fly, fly, fly \\
Let's fly \\
Fly, fly, fly, fly \\

I'm flying \\
I'm floating \\
I'm flying \\
I'm floating \\

Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
I'm an automatic transmission \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
I hold the pole position \\
Ohh baby I got persistence \\
Yeah I go the distance \\

\song{The Grim Reaper}

\note{[Written By: Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker/Funk]}

I'm the grim reaper \\
Chimney sweeper \\
Gate keeper \\
Running faster than a cheetah preying on the weaker \\
Got you in my point blank range as I take aim \\
I'm coming at ya like a hurricane \\
You're a scavenger scratching around for scraps \\
Sipping on cactus \\
Lighting matches \\
Unburied hatchets \\
Waiting for the ultimatum to be handed down from above \\
Never moved a muscle \\
Never gave a fuck \\

If it's bad for business and the visits from the hellhounds sniffing out stitches for the snitches \\
Then there's gotta be more than justice in discussion for the ones causing the corruption \\
Are you having an existential crisis \\
Time is priceless \\
Can't advise us \\
Analyse it \\
Break it down into small increments to repent \\

Rotting flesh odorous \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque \\
Rotting flesh odorous \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque \\

Heaven sent the silhouette of many wicked men \\
Fearless \\
Reckoning thinking they're the most powerful they've ever been \\
I can't begin to comprehend the arrogance dwindling inside the cranium \\
Grotesquely tortured by the wretchedness \\
Whiplash in the fortress between ya legs \\
Body bags hanging on the hills hoist with a peg as the stench orbits the homestead \\

Rotting flesh odorous \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque \\
Rotting flesh odorous \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque \\
Rotting flesh odorous \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque \\
Rotting flesh odorous \\
The grim reaper came to collect his debt \\

\song{Presumptuous}

\note{[Written By: Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie]}

So presumptuous \\
With tongue in cheek \\
So presumptuous \\
Belittle me \\
So presumptuous \\
Falling at your feet \\
So presumptuous \\
Don't agree with your negativity \\

Eggshell landmine stepping stones \\
Kindred spirits at a crossroads \\
The world we built is on a tilt \\
Bottled up inside and filled with guilt \\
Maybe you've got a god complex \\
Missing in action, didn't even notice \\
Sounds like negligence \\
Featherless, shaking in defense \\

So presumptuous \\
With tongue in cheek \\
So presumptuous \\
Belittle me \\

Sitting duck light bulb revelation \\
We're losing momentum \\
Blasé, naive sheepishly brazen \\
You're doing the bare minimum \\

So presumptuous \\
With tongue in cheek \\
So presumptuous \\
Belittle me \\
So presumptuous \\
Falling at your feet \\
So presumptuous \\
Letting go unwillingly \\

So presumptuous \\
With tongue in cheek \\
So presumptuous \\
Belittle me \\
So presumptuous \\
Falling at your feet \\
So presumptuous \\
What's it gonna take for you to see that \\

Shrug your shoulders \\
No response \\
It's become a known nuisance \\
You took for granted all our trust \\
And threw it all away \\
So presumptuous \\

Beast from below \\

Forever alone \\
Make you a new home \\

Smiling gator \\

Scare company \\

Your death comes so slow \\
Attack from below \\

\song{Red Smoke}

\note{[Written By: Kenny-Smith]}

Red smoke \\
The wool's been pulled \\
The dust won't settle \\
Red smoke \\
The fools still rule \\
The screaming kettles\

We're numb to the norm \\
Ever year it's clear that it ain't gonna disappear \\
It ain't some passing storm we can hide from \\

Red smoke \\
The wool's been pulled \\
The dust won't settle \\
Red smoke \\
The fools still rule \\
The screaming kettles \\

Not the only ones stuck in a bubble of terror watching them make all the errors \\
Like a kid with a magnifying glass \\
Each summer is getting hotter than the one before \\

Red smoke \\
Go away heatwave \\
You're all around -- north to the south \\
Red smoke \\
Go away heatwave \\
You're burning down \\
Our leaders are dumbfounded again \\

The answer \\
Plain as day \\
The answer \\
Plain as day \\
Drastic measures must be made \\
Before we incinerate \\

Red smoke \\
The wool's been pulled \\
The dust won't settle \\
Red smoke \\
The fools still rule \\
The screaming kettles \\
Red smoke \\
Go away heatwave \\
You're all around -- north to the south \\
Red smoke \\
Go away heatwave \\
You're burning down \\
Our leaders are dumbfounded again \\

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

Candles. Candles. Candles… \\

This little man is too hot to handle \\
Set the funeral on fire with the candles \\
Candles \\
Candles \\
Praying to the gods at the top of a mountain \\
You'd be better throwing all your pennies in a fountain \\
Candles \\
Candles \\

Your business is my business \\
Don't ask for forgiveness \\
Because time is a vessel and our little boat is leaking \\

Candles. Candles. Candles… \\

This little man is too hot to handle \\
Set the funeral on fire with the candles \\
Candles \\
Candles \\
I know your hands are up but I really can't stop \\
The sword is sharp so I wanna chop, chop, chop, chop \\
Candles \\
Candles \\

Luck here matters when walking under ladders \\
Because time is an arrow and our little bow has no strings \\

This little man is too hot to handle \\
Set the funeral on fire with the candles \\
Candles \\
Candles \\
My little heart is cold as a morgue \\
Let the weight of it drop like an iceberg \\
Candles \\
Candles \\
