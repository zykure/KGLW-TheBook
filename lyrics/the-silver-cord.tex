\song{Theia}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

The silver \word{cord}, a glowing thread, \\
Binds us to the higher divine. \\
A bridge immortal and unspoken \\
Helping us to truth-align. \\

\word{Theia}. Theia… \\

Theia, a force of destiny. \\
Fate intertwined with that of \word{Earth}. \\
A ticking clock of new reality, \\
A spiritual rebirth. \\
And when Theia it did impact, \\
The silver cord did snap as well. \\
Leaving the \word{soul} to sail on \\
A journey beyond which that we dwell. \\

Theia. Theia… \\

Meet our maker. Dance with Theia. \\

So perhaps our Theia's collision \\
Was not just a cosmic \word{death}, \\
But also a means of fusion and \\
The day we took our first breath. \\
Towards a higher, truer ego \\
In the vast and honeyed \word{sky}. \\
Leaving behind our mortal coil. \\
Silver cord now torn, the spirit flies. \\

Theia. Theia… \\

Meet our maker. Dance with Theia… \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

\word{Motor spirit}. Motor spirit… \\

Theia. Theia… \\

I'm just a \word{vessel}. \\
I'm just a poor boy travelling with my bodies. \\
I am free and I am marooned and tied to my bodies. \\

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Like a \word[dog on freeway]{dog on a freeway}, (Silver cord.) \\
I commit my \word{life} to end it my way.  (Silver cord.) \\

Like a dog on a freeway. (Theia. Theia.) \\
End it my way. (Theia. Theia.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Theia. Theia… \\

In Theia's void, a world yet named. \\
A throng of spirits fly into \\
That space in space not yet replaced. \\
To build a life and be renewed. \\
Out of the brine and cosmic foam, \\
One spirit grown in new gardens. \\
Without seeing, without hearing, \\
The body without organs. \\

Of what it's meaning is I know \\
That I am too tiny to be. \\
Cognisant of something that ripples \\
Across celestial sea. \\
Droplets on invisible space \\
Making gravitational waves. \\
I ride them to the astral beach \\
To be marooned with the body. \\

\song{The Silver Cord}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

The apostle of conscious dying. \\
Whispers to me ``Keep on trying. \\
Stay tethered to the cosmic sacrum. \\
Safe within the \word{Bardo} playground. \\
You'll cry tears that fall up to the \word{sky}. \\
While wrathful gods chant your name. \\
You'll never scream, you have no breath. \\
No refuge in between your \word{death}.'' \\

Power made by \word{Ptah}. \\
Beautiful child of \word{love}. \\
The gods ascribe praises to him. \\
Maker of things celestial and of things terrestrial. \\
He illumineth \word{Egypt}. \\
Traverser of the celestial heights in peace. \\

From the womb I materialise. \\
Terrified, uncircumcised. \\
My mothers love; \word{Hypericum}. \\
Awake for the caesarean. \\
Like a \word[dog on freeway]{dog on a freeway}. \\
I commit my \word{life} to end it my way. \\
I am deaf, I am a mute. \\
I am blind and I have broken through. \\

I'm just a vessel. \\
I'm just a poor boy travelling with my bodies. \\
Bodies. \\
Body imagery. \\
Imagery. \\
I am free. \\
I am marooned and tied to my bodies. \\
Bodies. \\
Body imagery. \\
Imagery. \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

Power made by Ptah. \\
Beautiful child of love. \\
\word{God}, ascribe praises to it. \\
Mighty lord of awe-inspiring terror. \\
Foremost creator of none is greater. \\
Ye illumineth the tempest. \\

Drink the gas in the house of fire, \\
Suspender of the sky who hammered out the \word{Earth}. \\
Firm of horns to set the oceans ablaze. \\
Foremost creator of none is greater. \\
Ye illumineth the tempest. \\

The apostle of conscious dying. \\
whispers to me ``Keep on trying. \\
Stay tethered to the cosmic sacrum. \\
Safe within the Bardo playground. \\
You'll cry tears that fall up to the sky. \\
While wrathful gods chant your name. \\
You'll never scream, you have no breath. \\
No refuge in between your death.'' \\

\song{Set}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Snout of a jackal and a tail of a \word{snake}. \\
Slithers and slinks through the \word{desert}, awake. \\
Gorges on \word[moonbeam]{moonbeams} and bathes in quantum foam. \\
Unchallenged in the infinite unknown. \\

Tornado bore down and lifted him high. \\
Throwing \word{Set} around with a windy cry. \\
His bones did shatter and his flesh did rend. \\
But still, the god did not bend. \\

\word{Osiris} of \word{Geb}, of \word{Nut} and dead, \\
Dutifully did what he was beset. \\

Slay the mighty Set… \\

Governs sandstorms with but a gesture. \\
Squeezing day into night with supernatural pressure. \\
\word{God} of duality and king of the fight. \\
Right eye the \word{Sun} and left the \word[moon]{Moon's} light. \\

His followers screamed, his enemies cheered. \\
As they watched their golden god disappear. \\
Be unto your storm with a final breath. \\
Set, it's time to meet your \word{death}. \\

Osiris of \word{Earth}, of \word{sky}, and birth. \\
Cut the \word{cord}, kill the king and reset. \\

Slay the mighty Set… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The god of death and rebirth too, \\
Out with the old and in with the new. \\
Ashes to gashes, the past of new \word{life} is made. \\
Brightened up the shadows, light up the shade. \\
\word{Horus} gave Set the downstairs snip-snip, \\
Poked out his eyes and ripped it to pieces. \\
Eighty years of conflict. \\

\word{Crocodile}-dog-birth. \\
\word{Lucifer} inverted, slender usurper, piece of work. \\
Struggling stranglehold akin to poison and going for broke. \\
An eye for a sun and an eye for the moon. \\
\word{Love} letter death threats written in the tomb. \\

The seed is set. \\
Cow-horn-headdress. \\
The seed is set. \\
Hieroglyphic. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Set. \\
Slay the mighty Set… \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

Converge. Converge… \\

The painter of death, the puppeting hand. \\
Colours all upon the canvas of their aeons expanse. \\
Sucking starlight from distant planets. \\
In spheres of dying fireballs of \word[heaven]{Heavens} they dance. \\

That God brought about a hellish era\\
Of ten brilliant bodies burning stellar. \\
This \word{dragon} never felt any bloodguilt. \\
Drink the fuckin' gas and kill. \\

Converge. Converge… \\
Converge. Converge… (Set. Set. Set.) \\

\song{Chang'e}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Ten \word[sun]{Suns} explode in the \word{sky}, \\
Sea boils and people die. \\
The earth quakes with a cosmic sound, \\
\word{Death} walks freely around. \\
If you dare to touch the voids, \\
Ride cerebral asteroids. \\
Swim the vast, cosmic sea \\
To find the key to set us free. \\

Be the auteur. \\
\word{Chang'e}. \\
The dreamer of \word[dream]{dreams}. \\
The voyager. \\
Chang'e. \\

Journey across scorching sands \\
Where neon colours do expand. \\
Find the portal glowing jade, \\
In you go, be not afraid. \\
As she sits upon the \word{Moon}, \\
Her lyre made of flesh and bone. \\
Strings are made of lightning bolts. \\
Twenty-five hundred volts. \\

Be the auteur. \\
Chang'e. \\
The dreamer of dreams. \\
The voyager. \\
Chang'e. \\
Sailing the moon-sea. \\

Sea of tears beneath her feet \\
Reflects her heart's eternal beat. \\
And as she plays, her mind takes flight \\
On wings of song, to realms of light. \\
On the astral planes they dance, \\
Traversing through the broad expanse. \\
Transcending mortal coil \\
To be whole once and for all. \\

Palace amongst stars, \\
Sweet treats open palmed. \\
Elixir romance, \\
Corpses slow dance. \\
\word{White rabbit} beside, \\
Float in the bright night. \\
Furnace now subdued, \\
Eclipse Sun and Moon. \\

Be the auteur. \\
Chang'e. \\
The dreamer of dreams. \\

My girl. \\

Mother of pearl. (Chang'e.) \\
Riding on \word[moonbeam]{moonbeams}. \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

Fire flickered and danced with hues \\
Of orange, red and deep burnt blues. \\
\word[snake]{Snakes} slither by, just out of sight. \\
\word{Lizard} and bat take wing in the night. \\
Around the fire, they circle slow \\
Wnd with locked minds a chant did grow. \\
Timbers of oak with knots so tight \\
Bear witness to spells cast in the night. \\

Witchcraft. Witchcraft… \\

Dark cedar forest in the mists of yore, \\
She yearns to live here forevermore. \\
Ghostly gods crying in the deep abyss, \\
Coalesce to songs of eternal bliss. \\

The adventure. \\
Chang'e. \\
What will you see? \\
Been here before. \\
Chang'e. \\
Immortality. \\

\song{Gilgamesh}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

A fiery temper. \\
Stranded in the deadly blender. \\
Weeping \word{human} clay, no surrender. \\
The pale \word{death}-threat sender leading him astray. \\
Ferocious, slaying feuds to gain the fame. \\
He's left to fend and hold the reins. \\
He can't protect the \word{wolf}-pack from the \word{Sun}-\word{god}. \\
Shamash combat. \\

I vow to disembowel. The battle begins. (Gilgamesh.) \\
The \word[heaven]{Heavens} turn to darkness. (Gilgamesh.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Five visions of biblical downpour. \\
(Tearing the rags and hairs tossed to the \word{river} beds.) \\
Fire breathing warblers perched on fallen. \\
(A prayer of shelter from the peaks.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh… \\

Glorious \word{photon}. \\
Invisible traveler. \\
Light and energy. \\
Galaxies zooming past you. \\
A particle pure. \\
Magnificent one. \\
Emitting glow. \\
Shining. \\
How long must I journey on? \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Bone dried swamplands swallow me. \\
(The lion skin wearing thin. The passing scorpions guarding.) \\
Wandering wild with passing misery. \\
(The key to immortality.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

House of dust, land of bone. \\
I ate dirt, I drank stone. \\
Beneath the razorback. \\
Wished to be insomniac. \\
Swam the flood, cleansed my sins \
And flew on thirteen winds. \\
Gemstone trees and scorpions. \\
Did it all, lived my \word[word]{dreams}. \\
Now I see man's folly. \\
Killed the bull, crossed the sea. \\
C'mon \word{snake}, punish me. \\
For immortality. \\

Great and ancient light. \\
Infinite distance. \\
Leaving its birthplace. \\
Going on adventures. \\
A galaxy spinning. \\
Many sights unseen. \\
Endless aeons. \\
Space, an unbroken chain. \\
Hear my name. \\

Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh… \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

\word[gila]{Gila}, gila! Gila, gila! Gila, gila! \\

Gilgamesh. Swan song… \\

Gilgamesh. \\

Such is this \word{life}. \\
What a waste, a dead space. \\
Nothing matters when you're dead. \\
Such is this life, as I said. \\
Open questions can be asked in the universe. \\
No one will answer, though. \\
Go forth and die, my \word{swan}. \\

Swan song. Swan song… \\

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\song{Swan Song}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Drink your booze and smoke your weed, \\
Drain the vein and bleed for me. \\
The ground is swaying beneath your feet, \\
You can't see shit and you can't breathe. \\
Kicked yourself in the teeth. \\

Drowning young in the fountain of youth, \\
You followed those breadcrumbs like a sleuth. \\
Once was full of youth and ruthless, \\
Now you're frail and limp and toothless. \\
Everything you say is useless. \\

'Tis the mothers voice on meek winds: \\
``Be unto the void for your sins.'' \\
Flowers droop their heads in sorrow, \\
\word[river]{Rivers} run with no tomorrow. \\

Throw in the towel, hang up your boots. \\
The last leaves falling, ripped from roots. \\
Diminishing hubris, sunken crown, \\
The sphere a jagged, arid mound. \\
Dumbest jester in the town. \\

The wrecking ball is fast approachinga \\
Engulfing spirit lingers, floating. \\
We bid farewell, all hope is losta \\
The clock has ticked its final tock. \\
A barren lifeless rock. \\

Birds do mourn and no longer trill. \\
The great \word{death} cometh to bring ill. \\
Crystal ball foretells dire fate. \\
Alas! The reckoning, too late. \\

\word{Swan} song. Death comes… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Let it out with a final sigh, \\
Our mother fades away. \\
Leaving the world behind, \\
Blistering in a blaze. \\
Flickering flamed-eyed, \\
I feel the earth shake. \\
Splitting without a splice. \\
It's irreversible, \\
We're moving counterclockwise. \\

Illuminate the finishing inquisition. \\
Embrace the overbearing inhibitions. \\
I lay my skull down and throw in the towel. \\
I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth. \\
Choking on the \word[earth]{Earth's} erosion. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

\word{Swan} song. Death comes. \\
(These breaths I breathe so bitter and bleak.) \\
\word{Swan} song. Death comes. \\
(This path we chose has caught up to speed.) \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Cut the \word{cord}. \\
Go explore. \\
Be untethered. \\
Be unequalled. \\
Grab the sword. \\
Be emperor. \\
Be yourself. \\
Be an orb. \\
Be your spirit. \\
Don't fear it. \\
Score the music of your essence. \\
Be a \word{photon}, luminescent. \\
Swan song. Death comes. \\

Stars fall from their lofty places, \\
\word{Earth} has been put through her paces. \\
Cosmic surgeons cut the cable, \\
Make a new world if you're able. \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

The eye dilates. \\
The air gyrates. \\
A gate in the \word{sky}. \\
A portal to die. \\
A shriek from space. \\
A mangled yell. \\
\word{Dragon} descends. \\
Welcome to \word{Hell}. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The world's brittle bones have broken as we speak. \\
The cracking \word{quicksand} is sucking from beneath. \\
The buildings turned to ashes, dust in the dead-end street. \\
We never wake up from this bad \word{dream}. \\

In fact, we're no longer living with no revisions. \\
Unconsidered \word{human}, lesser than a pigeon. \\
No limbo, no \word{citadel}, bombshell. \\
This plane nosedived straight into Hell. \\
Frozen over in explosion. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Swan song. Death comes. \\
(The ultimatum has admit its defeat.) \\
Cable torn. Extinction. \\
(Annihilation. Perpetually asleep.) \\

\song{Extinction}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I can see everything. I can be in the music… \\

Knocking on extinction's door, \\
Prisoner of others' war. \\
I see sullied, toxic seas, \\
Poisoned soil and felled trees. \\
Once paradise, now wasteland, \\
Shadow on the \word{Moon} expands. \\
\word{Set} tries chaos, but too late \\
To unseal our futures fate. \\
Yeah! \\

Ex-tinction. Extinction… \\

Era of rapid decline, \\
Become naught but dust of time. \\
Rain of sorrow from dread clouds, \\
\word[chang'e]{Chang'e's} tears have all dried out. \\
\word{Jesus} left us all alone, \\
\word[crumbling castle]{Castles crumble} with a groan. \\
Had a chance but let it slip \\
Into \word[heaven]{Heavens}, tempest rips. \\
Woo! \\

I can see everything. I can be in the music… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The archer drops their empty quiver, \\
Peacefully drowning in the empty \word{river}. \\
Slip into the vast astral abyss \\
And you can give space one last wish. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

You're a baby being born, \\
See the cable being torn. \\
Gravity-less asteroid \\
Zooming out into the void. \\
Yeah! \\

Ex-tinction. Extinction… \\

I can see everything. I can be in the music… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

\word{Magenta} beckons like a lighthouse, \\
Hypnotised and pulled into a pulsar. \\
Music of the spheres calls me to it. \\
The last thought I think: ``But, am I \word{human}?'' \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

I can see everything. I can be in the music… \\

\note{(Extended Mix Only)}

Flamethrower. \\
Flame. Thrower. \\
Throw a flame… \\

I can see everything. I can be in the music… \\

Just like \word[rats in the sky]{rats into the sky}\index{sky}, \\
Fly into the moonless night. \\
\word{Mirage city} on the ridge. \\
\word{Beowulf}, can you land \word{deadstick}? \\
Pilgrims with burnt offerings, \\
Spacesick for the whole voyage. \\
Metal horses on the flight, \\
Together, transcend this \word{life}. \\
Yeah! \\

I can see everything. I can be in the music. \\
I can see everything. I can fly  in the music. \\
