\song{Beginner's Luck}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

Join me at the table \\
If you'd like to place a bet. \\
All the cash that's filling your pockets \\
Is waiting to be spent. \\
I know you've never played but \\
Drinks are free, it's so bizarre. \\
Even if you loose a few chips it's \\
Cheaper than the bar. \\

Beginner's luck is on your side. \\
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes. \\

The beginner's luck. \\
Now don't mess it up. \\
If you get too stuck just bluff. \\
The beginner's luck is tough. \\

The king extends his hand. \\
He looks into my palm. \\
I don't know if he wants to shake it \\
Or cut it from my arm. \\
The dealer sits washing \\
All the burn cards from the deck. \\
I think he might be trying to clean them. \\
But I'd have to double-check. \\

Beginner's luck is on your side. \\
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes. \\

The beginner's luck. \\
Now don't mess it up. \\
If you get too stuck just bluff. \\
The beginner's luck is tough. \\

All your money's scared. \\
And you're down to betting skins. \\
But have you heard of a trick called spooking? \\
It'll help you win. \\
But tricks are just for children. \\
And cheating is a sin. \\
And now you're down to the felt on the table. \\
And security's moving in. \\

Beginner's luck of course backfired. \\
Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky. \\

The beginner's luck. \\
Now don't mess it up. \\
The beginner's luck. \\
Now don't mess it up. \\
The beginner's luck. \\
Now don't mess it up. \\
If you get too stuck just bluff. \\
The beginner's luck is tough. \\

\song{Greenhouse Heat Death}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Heat death. \\
Bake rot. \\
Torrid. \\
Char crop. \\
Heat death. \\
Hard yolk. \\
See flames. \\
Smell smoke. \\

My house is green. \\
You know what I mean. \\
My house was blue. \\
It cooked right through. \\

Come meet me inside. \\
Greenhouse we will fry. \\

Heat death. \\
Hormones. \\
Good broth. \\
Cook bones. \\

My house is fried. \\
All life has died. \\
My house was blue. \\
Beautiful too. \\

Come meet me inside. \\
Greenhouse we will die. \\

Heat death. \\
Bake rot. \\
Torrid. \\
Char crop. \\
Heat death. \\
Hard yolk. \\
See flames. \\
Smell smoke. \\

Come meet me inside. \\
Greenhouse we will die. \\
My house is green. \\

\song{Barefoot Desert}

\writtenby{Kenny-Smith/Craig/Mackenzie}

Lately I'm aware unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Breathing down my neck unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Never think ahead unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Come on in if you dare to my capsule of stress. \\

It's a misconcepted. \\
Story from perspective. \\
Lost in the barefoot desert. \\

Lately I'm aware unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Breathing down my neck unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Never think ahead unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Come on in if you dare to my capsule of stress. \\

I stand here corrected. \\
Misguided rejected. \\
Lost in the barefoot desert. \\

So who am I to judge, too stubborn to budge \\
When I'm down here and you're way up above. \\
Should've put some shoes on before I left the bus. \\

Now I've been neglected. \\
I'm the last one stranded. \\
Lost in the barefoot desert. \\
Why can't I leave (What's stopping me?) \\
From this prison? \\
Straight jacket and shackles at my feet I'm grounded. \\
Throw away the key for eternity. \\
I'm desperate. \\

Lately I'm aware unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Breathing down my neck unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Never think ahead unprepared barefoot desert. \\
Come on in if you dare to my capsule of stress. \\

\song{Muddy Water}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

It's hot. \\
It's mean. \\
Summer to me. \\
Green grass won't last. \\
Sky blue. \\
Me too. \\
Helicopter. \\
Flying over. \\
Shark bait. \\
Shark bite. \\
Cover up. \\
Sunburn. \\
Leather skin. \\
Heat stroke. \\

Make the dash across the amber coals to meet the sea. \\
So cold it freezes me. \\
My teeth are chattering. \\
Give me over to the \word{river}. \\
My place that loves me. \\
Gum leaves and tea trees. \\
The river is immortal. \\

I'm parched. \\
I'll cark. \\
The salty spray arrests. \\
No amount of bottled water could bottle the stress. \\
I think I'll stop breathing and sink. \\
I'm a boy. \\
I'm not a buoy. \\
I'm paralysed. \\
I'm paranoid. \\
Out of my element. \\

I prefer the muddy water. \\
I prefer the muddy water. \\
I prefer the muddy water. \\
I prefer the muddy water. \\

It's hot. \\
It's mean. \\
The beach to me. \\
Green grass won't grow. \\
Sky blue. \\
Me too. \\
I don't care for cricket. \\
And I don't care for waves. \\
And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays. \\

So I will jump into the river when you jump into the sea. \\
And feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet. \\
I'll lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree. \\
And let the muscle men on the beach bask in vanity. \\

I shall choose this life for me, any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway. \\

I prefer the muddy water. \\
I prefer the muddy water. \\
I prefer the muddy water. \\
I prefer the muddy water. \\

\song{Superposition}

\writtenby{Walker}

Superposition. \\
Real world wisdom. \\
Everything is moving to \\
The beauty of the system. \\

Total question. \\
Fearless reason. \\
We; one. I; many. \\
Superposition. \\

Think between space's seams. \\
So your eyes close \\
With my \word[dream]{dreams}. \\
Where truth exists. \\
In thought unbound. \\
You must know your \\
Superposition. \\

Journey towards \\
True destination. \\
Be in search of \\
Real direction. \\

All of a sudden \\
\word[heaven]{Heavens} unfasten. \\
The still will dance to \\
Superposition. \\

Exist outside the lace of time. \\
And your heart will pump the blood of mine. \\
Trace your finger from \\
Birth to hearse. \\
And drink the cum of life. \\
Visualise your worth and see the place where you'll curl up and die. \\
Be the squid and be the ink. \\
Me the glass and you the drink. \\

\song{Down the Sink}

\writtenby{Craig}

On the street \\
People make things happen. \\
Concrete \\
Buildings greet the skyline. \\
People meet \\
By the subway station. \\
Feel the heat \\
From the sidewalk pavement. \\
Under the city people's \word[dream]{dreams} collecting. \\
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin. \\

Down the sink. \\
Back and forth follow the stream the city is bleak forget all your dreams. \\
Down you'll go. \\
You can't compete whatever it is you can't defeat the pull of the street. \\
You follow the drain spinning around again and again again and again. \\
Once you're in. \\
Forget every place you've ever been the city is dark you'll never be clean. \\
Bow your head. \\

The street. \\
Is where. \\
The street is where people live. \\
The street. \\
Is where. \\
The street is where people die. \\

On the beat \\
Cops patrol the ally. \\
People cheat \\
One another for some. \\
Hanging meat \\
In the butcher's window. \\
Bitter sweet \\
Stench from in the gutter. \\
Under the city people's dreams collecting. \\
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin. \\

Down the sink. \\
Back and forth follow the stream the city is bleak forget all your dreams. \\
Down you'll go. \\
You can't compete whatever it is you can't defeat the pull of the street. \\
You follow the drain spinning around again and again again and again. \\
Once you're in. \\
Forget every place you've ever been the city is dark you'll never be clean. \\
Bow your head. \\

The street. \\
Is where. \\
The street is where people live. \\
The street. \\
Is where. \\
The street is where people live. \\
The street. \\
Is where. \\
The street is where people live. \\
The street. \\
Is where. \\
The street is where people die. \\

Under the city people's dreams collecting. \\
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin. \\

Down the sink. \\
Down the sink. \\
Down the sink. \\
Down the sink. \\

\song{The Great Chain of Being}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\

I am a rock with eyes to the sky. \\
I wait for my time to arrive. \\
I come to disturb the flow. \\
Dropped by a woman from a pocket in her coat. \\

The great chain of being. \\
Will fall to pieces in no time. \\

The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\

I usurp the precious stones. \\
I have come to take the throne. \\
I transcend the natural flesh. \\
I will lay your God to rest. \\

The great chain of being. \\
Will be unlinked to start again. \\

The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\
The great chain of being. \\

I see through your world's facade. \\
I decide to punish \word{God}. \\
Rocky meteor sparks fire. \\
Burn that God damn church to the ground. \\

I climb stairs to push you down. \\
I climb chains to cut you down. \\
I disrupt natural order. \\
Bring that sulking lamb to slaughter . \\

\song{The Last Oasis}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith/Walker}

\word{Dreaming} takes \\
My mind away. \\
It suffocates \\
My brain airwaves. \\

Optical illusion. \\
A sheet of water. \\
Heat profusion. \\
Search the corners. \\

Last oasis is like a fragile flower in a necropolis. \\
Alone in this weather that covers our world. \\
Last oasis is floating like a lost astronaut -- adagio. \\
We have nowhere to go. \\

Dreaming takes \\
My mind away. \\
It suffocates \\
My brain airwaves. \\

Optical illusion. \\
A sheet of water. \\
Heat profusion. \\
Search the corners. \\

The last oasis is the rarest bird that I've ever known. \\
Rara avis shedding her feathers one at a time. \\
The last oasis wobbles in the desert sands. \\
Standing sentinel in a prison, trapped in our home. \\

Dreaming takes \\
My mind away. \\
It suffocates \\
My brain airwaves. \\

Optical illusion. \\
A sheet of water. \\
Heat profusion. \\
Search the corners. \\

Optical illusions. \\
Living movements. \\
To be proven. \\
Says Zurbuchen. \\

The last oasis is like a flag beating in the wind. \\
The world has wasted and the squandered lands are compassionless. \\
The last oasis shines a beacon like a lighthouse over. \\
Lonely countries of death, like yellow sea. \\

\song{I'm Sleepin' In}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

I'm sleepin' in, in. \\
I'm sleepin' in. \\
I know within my body I need rest from muscle ache. \\
I really need a break so I'm sleepin' in, in. \\
I'm sleepin' in. \\
I know within my body I need to locate the switch. \\
Hidden in me which will turn me off. \\
Off, off, off. \\
I know within my body I need it. \\

I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\

I'm sleepin' in, in. \\
I'm sleepin' in. \\
I'm sleepin' in, in. \\
I'm sleepin' in. \\
I know within my body I've got sleepy appetite. \\
Pray the darkest night. \\
I'm sleepin' in, in. \\
I'm sleepin' in. \\

I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\
I need it, need it. \\

\song{The Wheel}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

We only sleep at the \word{wheel} that steers us into our future. \\
We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future. \\
Our minds unpack. \\
Muscles relax. \\
We are superfluous and in a stupor. \\
We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future. \\

Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\

There's help in need. \\
Seek to retreat. \\
Yet we decline. \\
Without mercy. \\
Destroying all that will keep us. \\
Heading for a better thesis. \\

We only sleep at the wheel that steers us into our future. \\
We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future. \\
Our minds unpack. \\
Muscles relax. \\
We are superfluous and in a stupor. \\
We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future. \\

Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\

Shivering pilgrims. \\
Climb the steeper. \\
Path to the idealistic reaper. \\
Destroying all that will keep us. \\
Heading for a better thesis. \\

The wheel that steers us into our future. \\
The wheel that steers us into our future. \\

Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\
Into our future. \\

With hope to prosper. \\
What can we offer? \\
Our allegiance surely suffers. \\
Destroying all that will keep us. \\
Heading for a better thesis. \\

The wheel that steers us into our future. \\
The wheel that steers us into our future. \\
