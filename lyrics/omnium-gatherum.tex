\song{The Dripping Tap}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The dripping tap won't be turned off \\
By the suits in charge of the world. \\
And our future's hanging on by a thread \\
With our heads in the sand. \\

The dripping tap won't be turned off \\
By the \word[god]{Gods} up above us. \\
Big \word{sky} country. \\
That we never hear from in these \\
Times of our dying needs. \\

A familiar sound ignored. \\
The compartmentalised thoughts \\
In that back corner of the drawer. \\
That drip, drip on the floor. \\
Don't get drowned. \\
Heed that sound. \\

Left the tap on, swampin' out of the sink. \\
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in. \\
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin. \\
Left the tap on, wish I learned how to swim. \\

Left the tap on, swampin' out of the sink. \\
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in. \\
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin. \\
Left the tap on, woo! \\

The dripping tap won't be turned off \\
B the suits in charge of the world. \\
And our future's hanging on by a thread \\
With our heads in the sand. \\

Drip, drip from the tap, don't slip. \\
Drip, drip from the tap, don't slip on the drip… \\

Everybody's on the same orbit \\
When they get old and moronic. \\
Get complacent and get bored. \\
That drip, drip on the floor. \\
Don't get drowned. \\
Heed that sound. \\

Left the tap on, swampin' out of the sink. \\
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in. \\
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin. \\
Left the tap on, wish I learned how to swim. \\

Left the tap on, swampin' out of the sink. \\
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in. \\
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin. \\
Left the tap on, woo! \\

The dripping tap won't be turned off \\
By the suits in charge of the world. \\
And our future's hanging on by a thread \\
With our heads in the sand. \\

The dripping tap won't be turned off \\
By the Gods up above us. \\
Big sky country. \\
That we never hear from in these \\
Times of our dying needs. \\

\song{Magenta Mountain}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker/Kenny-Smith}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Look past the dying trees, \\
Beyond waterless seas. \\
Atop the horizon, \\
Adjacent to the \word{Sun}. \\
Give my word that it's there: \\
\word{magenta} mountain. \\

What do you mean, \\
You can't see it? \\
My \word{life} must be a \word{dream}, \\
A living fantasy. \\
Disappeared in hot air: \\
Magenta mountain. \\

I don't believe you, \\
Your eyes deceive you. \\
Better check yourself in. \\
The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream. \\
Can't you see, you've gone insane? \\

I packed my bags and my swag \\
For the road. \\
Followed the bows of the \\
Ancient railroads. \\
Need to rendezvous \\
Where clouds can't misconstrue. \\
I'm certain it is real: \\
Magenta mountain. \\

You will say I'm crazy. \\
I will go on my way \\
'Cos it's what I need. \\
I'd cross a thousand seas \\
Just to prove I'm not mad: \\
Magenta mountain. \\

Magenta mountain… \\

It's you again. \\
Yeah! \\
I thought I saw a statue blink \\
And a bird with no head. \\
Land on a golden thread. \\
I rub my eyes, \\
What am I saying? \\
There's nothing there. \\

Magenta mountain. \\
Magenta mountain. \\
It's my sanctuary, that I wanna \\
Be chasing every chance I get. \\
Don't wanna be left. \\
Never not making it there. \\

What was confusing is now seducing. \\
Imagination is a powerful thing. \\
I see a flash of purple stone closing in. \\

Magenta mountain. \\
Magenta mountain. \\
It's my sanctuary that I wanna \\
Be chasing every chance I get. \\
Don't wanna be left. \\
Never not making it there. \\

I am tectonic, \\
I am megalithic. \\
My spirit runs mauve. \\
I am the mountain of which you dream. \\
I see you now behind the lens looking back at me. \\

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo… \\
We fell through a dream across clouds of glue. \\
Anamnesis crashing through. \\

Magenta mountain. Magenta mountain… \\

\song{Kepler-22b}

\writtenby{Craig/Mackenzie/McAll}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Nerdy kid at school with astral thoughts. \\
Wanted to be an astronaut \\
So I could be alone in space. \\

Get away. \\
\word[dreaming]{Dreamt} of Kepler-22b. \\
That's the place for me. \\

Didn't get the grades to be a NASA astronaut. \\
Couldn't knuckle down or focus on my schoolwork. \\
I became a ghetto engineer making shit out of glass to \\
Refract the light from distant stars. \\

Then I built a telescope. \\
So big. \\
Pointed it at Kepler-22b. \\
That's the place for me. \\

Good for ya. Obsession is good for ya… \\

Can you guess the first thing I seen \\
On Kepler-22? \\
A telescope pointing back at me… (At me.) \\

Good for ya. Obsession is good for ya… \\

\song{Ambergris}

\writtenby{Walker}

\vocalsby{Joey Walker}

Breathin' heavy candles. \\
Cut a face from a smile. \\
Preserve the torch, \\
It's imperative. \\
So douse some fuel on the fire. \\

Some dogs get whale eye. \\
Got a nose for that sea spice. \\
I wish that I had \\
Strength like that. \\
Dominion over my chemistry. \\

Didn't you know? \\
The camel's out of water. \\
The dog sweat on the seat, \\
Had me slippin' like a creep. \\

Haven't you heard? \\
They worked out double standards \\
Apply only to me. \\
Finally, it's working. \\
Ambergris. \\

Sculpting confidence with chimney smoke. \\
Record my weight in kidney stones. \\
CFCs gnaw at my intellect. \\
Colour coding my lymph nodes, ah. \\

Anthropomorphise everything, so \\
Use my blowhole like a microphone. \\
Every night I \word{dream} that you will see \\
The harpoon that I've grown to need. \\

Apropos, \\
The camel's out of water. \\
The dog sweat on the seat, \\
Had me slippin' like a creep. \\

Ergo, \\
I worked out double standards \\
Apply only to me. \\
Finally, it's working. \\
Ambergris. \\

Didn't you know? \\
The camel's out of water. \\

\vocalsby{Millicent Smith}

Who's this Sadie Sorceress? \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Let me tell you 'bout this 80s lady \\
Named Sadie. \\
She's wild like a witch. \\
She's more fly than Quidditch. \\
Smoking winnies \\
And drinking tinnies and Glenfiddich. \\
She's a roller blader skating, \\
Masquerading. \\
Squabble and gobble, \\
Eats blood and trouble. \\
Meddles in the metal in it. \\
She flies a handbag freak flag. \\

\word{Dragon} scale knapsack. \\
Fur, a pelt of mastodon. \\
Brings it on as carry on. \\
Sharp like parmesan, \\
Living non-partisan. \\
Leviathan cardigan, \\
Elegant artisan. \\
Concealing her identity \\
As an evil entity. \\
Anti-sanctity \\
In a vastity quantity. \\
Nightshade bringing \word{death} commander. \\
Have a gander, oleander. \\
Poisonous like buttercups. \\
She's dressing up to fuck shit up. \\

\vocalsby{Millicent Smith}

Hello \word{love}. \\
How are ya? \\

\vocalsby{Millicent Smith \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress… \\
Snapping necks with her broomstick, getting tortuous. \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

The pagan shaman sorceress. \\
Cackling, \\
Bat shit, \\
Non-conformist. \\
Moles on her nose so enormous. \\
The public, they can't ignore it. \\
Pitchforks banging on her door. \\
They wanna throw her overboard \\
To see if she floats or sinks into the floor. \\
There she goes bobbing on the surface \\
As the peasants and servants start to yell
``Hooray, sell her to the circus!'' \\
But she's had enough of playing it down \\
And playing it dumb. \\
She's dropping bombs on this \word{human} scum. \\
Ain't no thing as collateral damage \\
In this supernatural planet with a habit of getting savage. \\
Making sacrifices for the paradise of perdition, \\
The trials and tribulations for the forbidden religion. \\

\vocalsby{Millicent Smith \& Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress… \\
Snapping necks with her broomstick, gGetting tortuous… \\

\song{Evilest Man}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Evilest man. \\

I have no choice but to ignore \\
The voices in the newspaper. \\
I feel so sad from what I see, \\
Misinformation around me. \\

I have no faith in what I read, \\
The tabloids and the TV screen. \\
I see it just as clear \\
As the high definition images. \\

Don't wanna scare inaction into you, \\
But what you read you will turn into. \\
Pull up your socks or become a fox. \\
Do you wanna be just like the evilest man? \\
Murdochian, woo! \\

How very long must his arms be \\
To span the distance he can reach? \\
To make all our four corners square. \\
We're in his conservative lair. \\

I wonder if he knows this song… \\
Probably read it before it was done. \\
He probably hacked my phone. \\
I'll change the locks when I get home. \\

Isn't this the place for you? \\
Here in the garden we're safe for now. \\
Behind the tree, \\
The garden goblin's looking at me. \\
At me, at me. \\

What's that expression upon his face? \\
Doesn't it look like contempt. \\
Doesn't he want to let the garden grow \\
Like me and you? \\
Grow. \\

What does he want us to comprehend? \\
This garden was never his place. \\
Doesn't he want to let the garden grow \\

Go on then, blame it on the weather… \\

Gloomy days make you see the downside. \\
Like an arrow straight through the bullseye. \\
K-hole, spiral through space and time. \\
Stimuli, numb your mind. \\

Go on then, blame it on the weather… \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Even if you like pain, \word{life} ain't a sadist's game. \\
The devil ain't your friend, he's savage. \\
That man on the corner of the street \\
Pulled the rug from under your feet. \\
You're flying now, so you'd better stick the landing, \\
Otherwise you ain't got a leg to-- \\

\song{The Grim Reaper}

\writtenby{Kenny-Smith/Mackenzie/Walker/Funk}

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

I'm the grim reaper, \\
Chimney sweeper, \\
Gate keeper. \\
Running faster than a cheetah \\
Preying on the weaker. \\
Got you in my point blank range as I take aim. \\
I'm coming at ya like a hurricane. \\

You're a scavenger scratching around for scraps. \\
Sipping on cactus, \\
Lighting matches, \\
Unburied hatchets. \\
Waiting for the ultimatum to be handed down from above. \\
Never moved a muscle, \\
Never gave a fuck. \\

If it's bad for business and the visits from the hellhounds \\
Sniffing out stitches for the snitches, \\
Then there's gotta be more than justice in discussion \\
For the ones causing the corruption. \\

Are you having an existential crisis? \\
Time is priceless, \\
Can't advise us, \\
Analyse it. \\
Break it down into small increments to repent. \\

Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque. \\
Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque. \\

\word{Heaven} sent the silhouette of many wicked men. \\
Fearless, \\
Reckoning thinking they're the most powerful they've ever been. \\
I can't begin to comprehend \\
The arrogance dwindling inside the cranium. \\

Grotesquely tortured by the wretchedness. \\
Whiplash in the fortress between ya legs. \\
Body bags hanging on the hills hoist \\
With a peg as the stench orbits the homestead. \\

Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque. \\
Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque. \\
Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque. \\
Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper came to collect his debt. \\

Rotting flesh odorous. \\
The grim reaper cashes the cheque. \\
Rotting flesh odorous. \\
