\song{Head On/Pill}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

Just yesterday I sat across from my legs. \\
They weren't connected to me. \\
I couldn't see because my eyes weren't in me. \\
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on. \\

Head on. \\

Just yesterday I held the cup to my lips. \\
Pouring it deep in my throat. \\
Filling up me like a black enemy. \\
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on. \\

Head on… \\

I ate the wrong pill… \\

\song{I'm Not a Man Unless I Have a Woman}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman. \\
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman. \\

She's a hundred pounds of gold. \\
(Yes I am.) \\
She's a hundred pounds of gold. \\
(He's a hundred pounds of gold.) \\
I got mine so I don't mind - no. \\

I'm not a woman unless I have a man. \\
I'm not a woman unless I have a man. \\

I ain't gonna break your heart. \\
(Yeah, I know you won't.) \\
Because I'm done breaking hearts. \\

\song{God Is Calling Me Back Home}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

Meet me at the house on the top of the hill. \\
I've got two important people that I'm ready to kill. \\
I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do. \\

Santa's on the roof with his presents and sack. \\
He's got one hand with a blade and the other's an axe. \\
I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do. \\

Then I hear \word{God} call. \\
And all my hate is gone. \\
I hear him calling me back home. \\

Oh I heard God call. \\
And now my hate is gone. \\
I heard Him calling me back home. \\

God is calling me back home… \\

\song{30 Past 7}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

At 30 past 7 you know I could be better. \\
At 30 past 2 I'll get along with you. \\
I'm grumpy in the morning. \\
You know that when I'm yawning it's true. \\

That I'll be snappy towards you. \\
That I'll bite pieces out of you. \\

\song{Let Me Mend the Past}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith]}

Let me mend the past. \\
Let me see behind your mask. \\
You finally go around. \\
She stares at the ground. \\
And acts if you're not there. \\

Locks on the door. \\
Surveillance when you enter in \\
The hall such a pointless cause. \\
Her cups on my wall. \\
It's hard to be ignored. \\

Let me mend the past. \\
And make ends meet at last. \\
Before they bleed. \\
Don't wanna come across too weak. \\

Let me mend the past. \\
Let me mend the past. \\
This will be the last time I ask. \\
Let me mend the past. \\

\song{Mystery Jack}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

I am my mother's son. \\
And I'll keep doin' 'till the done gets done. \\
I wouldn't steal for free. \\
And I won't see you next to me. \\

'Cos I, oh I. \\
I, oh I hope I don't wake up. \\

'Cos I'm a lonely soul. \\
And I've got no friends on this road. \\
And I'm a mystery Jack. \\
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track to die. \\

Oh, die. \\
'Cos I, oh I hope I don't wake up. \\

\song{Pop In My Step}

\note{[Written By: Craig]}

Gonna shake the world, shake the world off my back. \\
I'm gonna hold my head high with the sun on my track. \\
Today I've got no troubles in sight. \\

Gonna put some pop in my step when I walk. \\
I'm gonna show my mood off when I walk and I talk. \\
Today I've got no troubles in sight. \\
Gonna turn around make everything that was wrong into right. \\

Gonna look past things that I know I'll regret. \\
Cause life's a little too short for those worries, you can bet on me. \\
Today I've got no troubles in sight. \\
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into… \\
Right, right. \\

When I wake up late in the morning you'll know. \\
It takes a few more hours before I'll know. \\
Today I've got no troubles in sight. \\
Gonna turn around make everything that was wrong into… \\
Right, right, right, right. \\

\song{Float Along -- Fill Your Lungs}

\note{[Written By: Mackenzie]}

I saw you in the carpet shades. \\
Then I felt you like a baby's face. \\
Just float along and fill your lungs. \\
Float along and breathe a deep breath. \\

I saw you in the paper folds. \\
And I saw you in my coffee mug. \\
Just float along and fill your lungs. \\
Float along and breathe a deep breath. \\

Just float along and fill your lungs. \\
Just float along and fill your lungs. \\
Just float along and breathe a deep breath. \\
Just float along and fill your lungs. \\
