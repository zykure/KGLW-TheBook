\song{I'm In Your Mind}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Everybody's lazy when they're tired. \\
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride. \\
And everybody's filing into line. \\
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride. \\. \\

When I'm in your mind. \\
Then I'm in your mind. \\

While everybody wants to suck you dry. \\
And dig a little deeper in your mind -- c'mon, deeper. \\
Everybody's lazy because they're fried. \\
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride . \\

\song{Cellophane}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Do-do-do-do. \\

You can watch your movies in 3D. \\
It's so strange. \\

With cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, oh. \\
Do-do-do-do. \\

You can color everything you see. \\
It's so strange. \\

With cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, oh. \\
Do-do-do-do. \\

You can watch your movies in 3D. \\
It's so strange. \\

With cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, cellophane. \\
Cellophane, oh. \\
Do-do-do-do. \\

\song{Empty}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Empty. \\
\word{Life} is nothing like it used to be. \\
People used to be so nice to me. \\
Feeling so empty. \\
Empty. \\
There is nothing deep inside of me. \\
Love is nothing like it used to be. \\
Feeling so empty. \\

Life is \word{death}. \\
It's because I shot it through its head. \\
I'm wandering around so lazily. \\
And feeling so empty. \\
And now I know. \\
It's because I never set it stone. \\
And I'm wandering around so lazily. \\
Feeling so empty. \\

But I don't feel empty when I'm with you. \\
I feel like you level me too. \\
Who? Empty. \\

What I got myself into. \\

\song{Hot Water}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

Eat up. \\
Vomit. \\
Date line. \\
Repay. \\
System failure. \\
Wish for old way. \\
Straighten. \\
Bend it. \\
Decline. \\
Spend it. \\
Believe sceptic. \\
Everybody's standing in. \\

Hot water. \\

Sheet of paper. \\
Mountain raper. \\
Moment silence. \\
I am spineless. \\
Echoes ending. \\
Whispers trending. \\
Heat is coming. \\
Everybody's stranded in. \\

\song{Am I In Heaven?}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say. \\
When all the bricks that built our brains will be turned into sand by the eternal wave. \\
If we save her we'll live on a star because mother nature made everybody else so far. \\

Am I in heaven? \\

Well everybody that I knew has jumped right in and taken over you. \\
And I swear even the ocean's changed its hue. \\
The lesson rings again. \\
Repeats within my brain. \\
Let's all put her to the test. \\
C'mon suck our mother's breast. \\

And everybody that I knew has taken bits and pieces out of you. \\
And I swear even the \word{sky} has changed its blue. \\
The lesson rings again repeats within my brain. \\
Let's all put her to the test. \\
C'mon suck our mother's breast. \\

\song{Slow Jam 1}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

I need to slow my mind down low. \\

When it feels like coming on. \\
Boy it makes it hard to talk for me. \\

\song{Satan Speeds Up}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

You brought us to your gift of generosity. \\
And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils. \\
When I stop to think of all that. \\

Every \word{life} is like a song that takes forever to be sung. \\
When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils. \\
When I stop to think of all that we've done. \\
\word[satan]{Satan's} at the door. \\

Every second, every minute, every hour, every day. \\
He's watching you \\
And passing judgement to everybody you hold dear. \\
When I stop to think of all that we've done. \\
Satan's at the door. \\
Who's he looking for? \\

\song{Her and I (Slow Jam 2)}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love. \\
The sun shone through into a wave of thought. \\
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her. \\
Her will will shine from up above on us. \\

Because every day I build on precious her and I. \\
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel. \\
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love. \\
So the sun can shine a little brighter. \\

On her and I. \\
