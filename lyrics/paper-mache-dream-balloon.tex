\song{Sense}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

It's in vogue to be feckless \\
When it comes to the mother taking care of us. \\
I know it's so conventional. \\
But it don't make no sense at all. \\

But in fact it's a pattern. \\
Everything I hear will always make me ashen. \\
I know it's recognisable. \\
But it don't make no sense at all. \\

Ohhhh! No, no, no sense at all. \\

People pay for their coupé. \\
But they can't pay their taxes for the freeway. \\
I know it's so predictable. \\
But it don't make no sense at all. \\

And some people say it's on their radar. \\
But they drive a million miles in their fast car. \\
I know it's so invisible. \\
But it don't make no sense at all. \\

Ohhhh! No, no, no sense at all. \\
Ohhhh! No, no, no sense at all. \\

But in fact it's a pattern. \\
Everything I hear will always make me ashen. \\
I know it's recognisable. \\
But it don't make no sense at all. \\

Ohhhh! No, no, no sense at all, oh… \\
Ohhhh! No, no, no sense at all. \\

\song{Bone}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Bone, bone… \\

Hands and toes, feet and head. \\
Carrion to be fed. \\
Any dog can chew over my bone. \\
All my wine's gonna turn into blood. \\
When my name is called \\
I'm just a pile of bone. \\

But when I'm gone \\
And I'm dead \\
What will be inside my head? \\

Bone, bone… \\

Fingernail, chest and feet. \\
Carrion good to eat. \\
Any dog can chew over my bone. \\
And all my wine's gonna turn into blood. \\
When my gun is shot \\
I'm just a pile of bone. \\

When I'm gone \\
And I'm dead \\
What will be inside my head? \\
Will all my stitches be unsewn? \\
If \word{Heaven} is a place I know \\
I won't be taking my bones. \\

Bone, bone… \\

If Heaven is a place I know \\
I won't be taking my bones. \\
Will all my stitches be unsewn? \\
And when I'm gone \\
And I'm dead \\
What will be inside my head? \\

Bone, bone… \\

\song{Dirt}

\writtenby{Walker}

Handshakes and bitter rows \\
Are the common conjecture. \\
I can dissect anything \\
And save the skin for later. \\

I know it's just a time \\
And things will get better. \\
But I don't mind much anyway. \\
Vampire reflection. \\

Gestured in our selfish understanding. \\
Tensions only surface when you're hurt. \\
Like a magpie's morning monologue. \\
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt. \\
The dirt, the dirt. \\

Make time to say you're right. \\
You should already know this. \\
With next to no pretension. \\
Still, I'm walking on egg shells. \\

Catch your breath, I'm heading out. \\
Be sure others will notice. \\
This is just a product of \\
Lack of reflection. \\

Like a magpie's morning monologue. \\
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt. \\
The dirt, the dirt. \\

\song[Paper Mache Dream Balloon]{Paper Mâché Dream Balloon}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Stuck in a \word{daydream} \\
Under a \word{moonbeam}. \\
Head on my pillow at home. \\
Drunk are the people \\
Outside my window. \\
Full of testosterone. \\

When I get trouble my way \\
Like paper mâché. \\
They stick to chimera balloon \\
And I kick it out my door. \\

Paper mâché \word{dream} balloon! \\

Are you eluding \\
That I am brooding. \\
Moping around on my own. \\
Stuck in a daydream \\
Under a moonbeam. \\
Head on my pillow at home. \\

When I get trouble my way \\
Like paper mâché. \\
They stick to chimera balloon \\
And I hide it in my drawer. \\

Paper mâché dream balloon! \\

When I get trouble my way \\
Like paper mâché. \\
I stick them to a dream balloon \\
And I kick it out my door. \\
And I hide it in my drawer. \\

\song{Trapdoor}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap… \\
Trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor… \\

And everybody knows what's under the door. \\
And everybody goes to great lengths, for sure \\
To hide themselves away \\
And keep the \word{beast} at bay. \\
'Cos everybody knows: \\

Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap… \\
Trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor… \\

And everybody knows what's under the door. \\
And everybody goes to great lengths, for sure \\
To hide themselves away \\
And keep the \word{beast} at bay. \\
'Cos everybody knows: \\

Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap… \\

\song{Cold Cadaver}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Dark and cold \\
Out my front window. \\
I can hear her say \\
From two miles away. \\

``This can't be over, can't be over.'' \\

Heard her before. \\
Knocking at my front door. \\
I said, ``What's the problem?'' \\
She said, ``It's the cold cadaver, cadaver.'' \\

``Cold cadaver, cadaver!'' \\

I was sleeping \\
When I heard her preaching. \\
I said, ``What's the problem?'' \\
She said, ``It's the cold cadaver, cadaver.'' \\

``Cold cadaver, cadaver!'' \\

My tongue is big. \\
But not as big as his. \\
Nostrils, mouth and ears \\
Start to disappear. \\

``This can't be over, can't be over.'' \\
Heard me before. \\
Banging on her front door. \\
She said, ``What's the problem?'' \\
I said, ``It's the cold cadaver, cadaver.'' \\

``Cold cadaver, cadaver…'' \\

\song{The Bitter Boogie}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter… \\

The bitter \word{boogie} comes without a warning. \\
When it's inside of me, it is exhausting. \\
I don't like the way it makes me freeze up \\
And what it makes me say. \\

I know it comes off bitter. \\
Bitter, bitter, bitter. \\
But roll with it. \\

Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter… \\

I wouldn't like to say I didn't warn ya \\
'Cos bitter boogie comes without a warning. \\
I really hate the way it mess' my mind up \\
And all it makes me say. \\

I know it comes off bitter. \\
Bitter, bitter, bitter. \\
But roll with it. \\

Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

From the first glance \\
Had no chance. \\
Making an exception \\
That would outlast. \\
Searching for a new obsession. \\

Yet I'm too bitter \\
To reconsider (Bitter, bitter.) \\
My options twice (Bitter, bitter.) \\
Before I ask for your advice. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter… \\

\vocalsby{Ambrose Kenny-Smith}

I've been grieving for no reason. \\
That seems wise. \\
Married to the pipe \\
With no ambition besides. \\

I'm too bitter \\
To reconsider (Bitter, bitter.) \\
My options twice (Bitter, bitter.) \\
Before I ask for your advice. \\

\vocalsby{Stu Mackenzie}

Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter… \\

\song{N.G.R.I. (Bloodstain)}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Everyone thinks I am shallow \\
When I'm hiding in my room. \\
Safe within my zone. \\
All the demons that I summon \\
Wipe the blood off of the floor. \\
It's my only law. \\

Sorry! \\

N-G, R-I. \\
Mundane. \\
Bloodstain. \\
N-G-R-I. \\
In my brain. \\
Keep it clean. \\
Bloodstain. \\

Bloodstain… \\

I've awoken from my slumber. \\
I was \word{dreaming} 'bout a flood. \\
Covered in my blood. \\
Now my pits are getting sweaty. \\
It's a sign I've got to go. \\
Back to where I know. \\

Sorry! \\

Suffer endlessly. \\
Suffer endlessly. \\
Forever giving in to. \\

N-G, R-I. \\
Mundane. \\
Bloodstain. \\
N-G-R-I. \\
It's plain. \\
Wipe it up. \\
Bloodstain. \\

N-G, R-I. \\
Mundane. \\
Bloodstain. \\
N-G-R-I. \\
In my brain. \\
Squeaky clean. \\
Bloodstain. \\

Bloodstain… \\

\song{Time = Fate}

\writtenby{Craig}

It's always in between \\
The lines you thought you read. \\
The time and distance, keyhole, \\
Needle through the thread. \\
I can't help but be sad sometimes. \\
Talk to me see what's on my mind. \\

If I could step backwards \\
Somewhere into the past. \\
I'd relive that great party \\
Where we had a blast. \\
Pondering things in the past makes you blind. \\
Look ahead you'll not waste your… \\

Time mends furrowed brows. \\
I can't help but thinking now. \\
Back here I'll wait. \\
Please don't let the past be my… \\
Fate. \\

It takes two cats to enjoy \\
A cool jamboree. \\
It takes three to remember \\
That one differently. \\
Memory's a fog it gets thicker with time. \\
Look at the clock its hands read the… \\

Time mends furrowed brows. \\
I can't help but thinking now. \\
Back here I'll wait. \\
Please don't let the past be my… \\

\song[Time = \textdol{}\textdol{}\textdol{}]{Time = \$\$\$}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Well, if time is money \\
Then it sounds funny \\
To give me so much time \\
And no money nearby. \\

I know when my gums start bleeding \\
And pissing over my teeth \\
That I'm low on my buck \\
Without any luck. \\
And all I gotta say: \\

Why is time my money? \\
'Cos it sounds funny \\
To give me so much time \\
And no money nearby. \\

I know when my eyes start itching \\
That I'm in need of a fuss \\
And I'm low on my buck \\
Without any luck. \\
Head in my hands \\
To see that I am so stuck \\
And all I gotta say, all I got to say. \\

Why is time money? \\
'Cos it sounds funny \\
To give me so much time \\
And no money nearby. \\

Time is money, time is money… \\

\song{Most Of What I Like}

\writtenby{Walker}

Most of what I like \\
Is given to me by \\
The one that I love. \\
Bears the onus every time. \\

Technically I don't deserve \\
To live this kind of \word{life}. \\
Perturbed at what I might become. \\
Unchanging every time. \\

Ecstasy is what I'm needing. \\
I'm bleeding from the eyes. \\
You always shut your eyes \\
When you look me in the eyes. \\

Always caressing \\
The ropes which I've frayed. \\
The corpse that I'm dressing \\
Should never be displayed. \\
Should never be displayed… \\

Face to face is nice. \\
But sharper than a knife. \\
I teeter on its edge. \\
Just waiting to be sliced. \\

Returning home brain dead. \\
And you inject the life. \\
Appeal to me \word{love}. \\
Remake, rebuild, revise. \\

Restavit is what I'm bleeding. \\
A laxative to cry. \\
You always shut your eyes \\
When you look me in the eyes. \\

Always caressing \\
The ropes which I've frayed. \\
The corpse that I'm dressing \\
Should never be displayed… \\
