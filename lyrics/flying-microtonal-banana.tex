\song{Rattlesnake}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

\word{Rattlesnake}. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattles me. \\

Isolation. \\
Trepidation. \\
Don't fear nothing. \\
\word{Snake} is bluffing. \\
Whips his tail. \\
Sends you running. \\

Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattles me. \\

Vegetation. \\
Aggravation. \\
Found him hiding. \\
Snake is smiling. \\
Whips his tail. \\
Leaves you riling. \\

Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattles me. \\

Rattle, rattle, rattle… \\

Hibernation. \\
Altercation. \\
Don't get angry. \\
Snake is cranky. \\
Whips his tail. \\
In a frenzy. \\

Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattlesnake. \\
Rattles me. \\

Rattle, rattle, rattle… \\

I'm the \word{serpent}. \\
\word[devil]{Devil's} servant. \\
Time to meet your end. \\

Fangs are ready for the strike. \\
Deadly razor sharp. \\
Poison with a single spike. \\
While you're immobile. \\

Screaming like a maniac. \\
After my attack. \\
Crying like a baby child. \\
In exile. \\

Sweat drips out of every pore \\
As I bite you more and more and more and \\
Take one last look at your captor. \\
And hear my tail \\
Rattling 'til your death. \\

Rattling 'til your death. \\

Rattle, rattle, rattle… \\

Rattle, rattle, rattle… \\

I'm the serpent. \\
Devil's servant. \\

\song{Melting}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Thawing ices. \\
Worse than ISIS. \\
Worse than the most deadly virus. \\
Living harmonious. \\
Is desirous. \\
How can we with absent-mindedness? \\

The earth is melting down. \\
Our home and our playground. \\
Won't be fit for children when our world. \\
Has melted down. \\

Melting. \\
Melting, melting, melting… \\

Conflagrated. \\
And cremated. \\
When the world is consummated. \\
Devastated. \\
Populated. \\
World of isolated mortal folk. \\

The earth is melting down. \\
Our home and our playground. \\
Won't be fit for children when our world. \\
Has melted down. \\

Melting. \\
Melting, melting, melting. \\

Toxic air is \\
Here to scare us. \\
Fatal fumes from melting ferrous. \\
All we discuss \\
Is superfluous. \\
If we can't keep our hands to ourselves. \\

The earth is melting down. \\
Our home and our playground. \\
Won't be fit for children when our world. \\
Has melted down. \\

Melting. \\
Melting, melting, melting… \\

\song{Open Water}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Open water. \\
Where's the shore gone? \\
How'd I falter? \\
Open water. \\

Height of the sea \\
Will bury me. \\
And all I see is \\
Open water. \\

Open water. \\

Open water. \\
Where's the shore gone? \\
How'd I falter? \\
Open water. \\

Plight of poor me. \\
No use for screaming here. \\
I'll drown in \\
Open water. \\

Open water. \\

Open water. \\
Where's the shore gone? \\
How'd I falter? \\
Open water. \\

The sea is all \\
That I can see. \\
I'll die alone in \\
Open water. \\

Open water. \\
Open water. \\
Open water. \\

I know something is lurking in \\
The depths of murky water. \\
There are ripples and bubbles appearing \\
Over by the sunken ship. \\

And bells are ringing in my head. \\
I think I'm done -- I think I'm dead. \\
As something pulls my paddling leg under… \\

Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take. \\
This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs. \\

And deeper darker bluish dread. \\
The pressure's squeezing on my head. \\
The \word[kraken]{Kraken's} got the best of me this time. \\

\song{Sleep Drifter}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Drifting in and out of sleep. \\
Is my favourite state to be. \\
I can see you next to me. \\
And it is lovely. \\

Sleep drifter, sleep drifter… \\

I can feel you touch me. \\
And I can hear you breathing. \\
Please no one wake me. \\
When I'm sleep drifting. \\

Drifting in and out of sleep. \\
Reality begins to fray. \\
You become so close to me. \\
In a hotel far away. \\

Sleep drifter, sleep drifter… \\

I can know you're right here. \\
And I can catch your crying tear. \\
We can be so close dear. \\
When I'm sleep drifting. \\

\song{Billabong Valley}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

Outlaws on the run. \\
Faster than a stolen gun. \\
Tied naked to the trees. \\
Killed so gruesomely. \\
Burning tents to the ground. \\
Cops won't wave them down. \\
The most wanted men. \\
Bushrangers reigning in. \\

Bloodthirsty tendencies. \\
Antiauthority. \\

Mad dog Morgan. \\
He never gave a warning. \\
Mad dog Morgan. \\
Shot in the back by morning. \\

\song{Anoxia}

\writtenby{Walker}

I don't care. \\
``Take a chance,'' you said. \\
Melt the coins in your pants. \\
But make no sound for me my friend. \\

Be calm in the wind. \\
Tearing through town. \\
A dog-less bark. \\
Is a lonely sound. \\

The cold ground moans. \\
Untold histories. \\
It sings its birdsong \\
To me. \\

A family sleeps \\
At the crease. \\
They died by fire \\
But they felt no heat. \\
I could wear \\
A jumper sewn \\
Out of the \\
Irony. \\

We waste no time. \\
Leaving in light. \\
A different sun \\
Bakes the breeze tonight. \\

My mind wanders \\
Alone. \\
Let my body \\
Be aquatic. \\

Burn us a road \\
Straight to the sea. \\
I'll be your seatbelt \\
Baby. \\

\song{Doom City}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Doo-doo-doo-doom city. \\
Doo-doo-doo-doom city. \\

I think I'll die. \\
When doom city air this way comes. \\
He, in Empyrean \\
Breathes from his mouth and over tongue. \\
Sky will crucify. \\
Tear little holes in my lungs. \\
I think I'll die. \\
When doom city air this way comes. \\

Doom City. \\
Doom City. \\

Doo-doo-doo-doom city. \\
Doo-doo-doo-doom city. \\

Spark in firmament. \\
Doom city sky opens up. \\
He disorients. \\
Everyone's lives with his breath. \\
Charged with particles. \\
Doom city air rips me up. \\
Unbelievable. \\
Doom city sky makes him laugh. \\

Doom City. \\
Doom City . \\

\song{Nuclear Fusion}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Walker}

Look into the sky and see the pattern \\
Reflecting in your eye from a distance. \\
Mirroring the stars are the atoms. \\
Mixing up like a cocktail. \\

The \word[devil]{devil's} inside all the detail. \\
The tittle runs wild under veil. \\
Coming together in the pattern. \\
Fit tightly like a dovetail. \\

Nuclear fusion. \\

All the bonds that be \\
Couldn't break us. \\
Exponentially. \\
In fine feather. \\
We're essentially \\
One being. \\

All the bonds that be \\
Couldn't tear us \\
From eventually \\
Fusing tightly. \\
We're essentially \\
One being. \\
Nuclear Fusion. \\

Ocean like a moat fortification. \\
Separating me from restoration. \\
My spirit leaves my body in frustration. \\
Flying through the world in radiation. \\

The devil's inside all the detail. \\
The tittle runs wild under veil. \\
Coming together in the pattern. \\
Fit tightly like a dovetail. \\

Nuclear fusion. \\

All the bonds that be \\
Couldn't break us. \\
Exponentially. \\
In fine feather. \\
We're essentially \\
One being. \\

All the bonds that be \\
Couldn't tear us \\
From eventually \\
Fusing tightly. \\
We're essentially \\
One being. \\
Nuclear Fusion. \\

All that I ever see is nuclear fusion. \\
All that I ever hear is nuclear fusion. \\
