\song{Automation}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Join the last migration. It's fun. Fuck the system. \\
Your new best mate is great. King of a bald primate. \\
We are not worthy of our heir's glory. \\
Mental rotation for the overlord. \\

Super-organism caused a schism bending light through prisms. \\
Cyber-surgeon. JavaScript person. Digital cleanse. \\
Tell all your friends the neural network's at work. \\

Automation. Automation. Automation… \\

Prepare for mutation because after all I'm sure I heard the crack of doom. \\
\word{Death} kiss. Everyone should be talking 'bout this. \\
\word{Human} \word{karma} dinosaur inside a simulation. \\
Automation. \\

Automation. Automation. Automation… \\

\song{Minimum Brain Size}

\writtenby{Walker}

Riddle me this. Did you ever grow? \\
Break the spider's legs just to feed the crow. \\
Sympathetic crowds are not well endowed. \\
Dance like flies on shit swarming in the clouds. \\

This is to all of the people who had it coming. \\
A few biccys too many? I'm so lonely. \\
It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it. \\
I'll open their eyes to minimum brain size. \\

Re-enter the uterus and refund all your cells. \\
Do it back-to-front like nobody else. \\
Stay there for a while. ``When you're back inside, \\
You will not be missed'' said the tear to the eye. \\

It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know. \\
Parasitic mob. Faceless undertow. \\
Himpathetic bro. You're weaker than you know. \\
You don't have a say anymore. \\

This is to all of the people who have it coming. \\
A few biccys too many. I'm so lonely. \\
It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it. \\
Radicalise to minimum brain size. \\

It's pathetic though. You're weaker than you know. \\
Parasitic mob. No worse off alone. \\
Himpathetic bro. You're weaker than you know. \\
You don't have a say anymore. \\

At the center of it all. You ain't got the gall. \\
Pissing on a flame. Standing on a ball. \\
It's pathetic though. You're weaker than you know. \\
You don't have a say anymore. \\

\song{Straws In The Wind}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

Galvanising uncertainty. \\
Mindful of the weary inkling that is lurking. \\
Hierarchy it's been cracking aegis. \\
Embodied in this black heart shameless. \\

Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim. \\
I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin. \\

Cooking something raw. Cooking something big. \\
Pandemonium. Selfish \word[pig]{pigs}. Headless chickens scared shitless. \\
The media will never quit. \\

Allegro fueled with discontent. \\
Mortal traffic lights signalling when to stay or go. \\
Condescending expendables botched to a clock. \\
Novice to the dilemma with nothing clever left in stock. \\

Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? Straws in the wind. \\
Is it all ending? Like a blunder brewing full to the brim. \\
I can hear \word[hell]{Hell's} kitchen and they're singing hymns. \\

Cooking something raw. Cooking something big. \\
Pandemonium. Selfish \word[pig]{pigs}. Headless chickens scared shitless. \\
The media will never quit. \\

The affluent with a bad omen hanging. \\
Monstrosity scarce breaking freedom. \\
Shrewd and not in the mood to disillude. \\
We are the pillars of a forgotten pier. \\

Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind? \\
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind? \\

Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Like a slumber and we've all just awoken. \\
I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin. \\

Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\
Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? \\

\song{Some Of Us}

\writtenby{Craig/Mackenzie}

Ancient tombs like sand filled wombs of peoples \word{life} past. \\
Understand everything. Melted iron. Untold aeons. \\
Crafted demise. Destroying everything. \\

Black sand timelines. Shifting skylines. \\
Faded guide signs revealing everything. \\
Ancient Thracians from lost nations. \\
Long gone people understand everything. \\

Some, some of us see. Some, some of us don't. \\
Assured everything turns into dust. \\

Rigor mortis fossil tortoise remains dormant underneath everything. \\
Ageless microbes reveal xenophobes. \\
Endless plague thus infecting everything. \\

Sapien rituals born of mind tools. \\
Sects of false gods fade into everything. \\
Eternal tribes of purgatory scribes. \\
Ancient words thus foretelling everything. \\

Some, some of us live. Some, some of us die. \\
Assured everything turns into dust. \\
Some, some of us live. Some, some of us die. \\
Assured everything turns into dust. \\

\song{Ontology}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Now there is something that's on my mind. \\
Now there is something I cannot hide. \\
Why is there anyone? \\
Why do we think? \\
What is the point of it? \\
Why anything? \\
Why is there anything? \\
What is the link? \\
What is the point of it? \\
Why anything? \\

Don't question. \\
Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing. \\
Be free. \\

What can be said to exist inside a simulation inside my mind? \\
What is the meaning? \\
What is a thing? \\
What is the point of it? \\
Why anything? \\
How many levels of ontology? \\
What is the point of it? \\
Why anything? \\

Don't question. \\
Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing. \\
Be free. \\

\song{Intrasport}

\writtenby{Walker}

Don't take it personally. This is not about you. \\
I begin to slide inward and throughout to. \\
Shatter the static silencing my mind. \\
Find the rhythm and set course to collide. \\

Don't take it personally. My hands are disappearing. \\
Dissolving in a tear. I am not needed here. \\

Starting to feel something. I think I'm taking off. \\
I think I'm feeling something. Will I evaporate? \\
Is this me feeling something? I've got a bird's eye view. \\
I have shed my skin. Look at me now. \\

Intra intrasport. Perish to my thoughts. \\
My hand is on the gun. Intra intrasport. \\
Get to me before my face splashes in the \word{sky}. \\

I used to \word{dream} about killing certain people. \\
Dreams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle. \\
Those feelings that I had were building up to something. \\
I feel a schism in the rhythm. Now I'm running. \\

My hair is liquifying. My tastebuds are igniting. \\
It's true I am evolving. It's all relative. \\

Starting to feel something. I think I'm taking off. \\
I think I'm feeling something. Will I evaporate? \\
Definitely feeling something. I've got a bird's eye view. \\
I have shed my skin. Look at me now. \\

Intra intrasport. Perish to my thoughts. \\
My hand is on the gun. Intra intrasport. \\
The feeling's on the floor. My face splashes in the sky. \\

Don't do it. \\

\song{Oddlife}

\writtenby{Mackenzie/Kenny-Smith}

All this rock'n'roll is bad for my ears. \\
Lemme tell you one thing about my \word{life}. It's weird. \\
All this headbanging is bad for my brain. \\
Lemme tell you one thing about my life. It's strange. \\

Sugarplum fairy dances now. \\
Echoed feet on the hallowed ground. \\
Energy peaks on the voyager's crown. \\
Back to the bus for another round. \\
Managing feats by managing feet. \\
Head of the hydra tastes the breeze. \\
Conduit sees from the living room suite. \\
Boredom is what boredom breeds you see. \\

So deranged. Life is strange. It's \word{human} odd life. \\

All this indecision in anthropoids. \\
Lemme tell you one thing about our life. It's odd. \\
All this wire walking upon the knife. \\
Lemme tell you one thing about human odd life. \\

Sugarplum fairy dances now. \\
Echoed feet on the hallowed ground. \\
Energy peaks on the voyager's crown. \\
Back to the bus for another round. \\
Managing feats by managing feet. \\
Head of the hydra tastes the breeze. \\
Conduit sees from the living room suite. \\
Boredom is what boredom breeds you see. \\

Bitumen crossroad knife. It's human odd life. \\

No concept of geography. \\
I wake up and I'm still fatigued. \\
I'm drinking 'til I'm dead asleep. \\
Riding high 'til I'm back home in one piece. \\
Another carpark in the middle of nowhere. \\
Another promoter hanging in your hair. \\
Another backstage green room to prepare. \\
It's an odd life gotta be aware. \\

It's an odd life 'til you get it right. \\
It's an odd life 'til you get in the stride. \\
It's an odd life, 'til you get it right. \\
It's an odd life 'til you get in the stride. \\

Odd life. Odd life. Odd life… \\

\song{Honey}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

You taste like honey. All warm and runny. \\
Kinder than a candy. Effervescent shandy. \\
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya. \\
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion. \\

Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along. \\
And the germs outside I'll keep you from. \\
Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song. \\
While the mead I make can brew for you. \\

You taste like honey. \\
You taste like honey. \\
You taste like honey… \\

\word{Life} is what you do in it while you're floating through it. \\
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it. \\
We're endless motion. Drink to that notion. \\
Buoyant is your spirit. Gotta keep me near it. \\

Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along. \\
And the germs outside I'll keep you from. \\
Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song. \\
While the mead I make can brew for you. \\

You taste like honey. \\
You taste like honey. \\
You taste like honey… \\

Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it. \\
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it. \\
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya. \\
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion. \\

\song{The Hungry Wolf Of Fate}

\writtenby{Mackenzie}

Would you throw our construction to the hungry \word{wolf} of fate? \\

Do it again cos we're mindless piss-ants. \\
Do it again cos we haven't learned sense. \\
Do it again so we auto-cremate. \\
Don't do it again because it isn't safe. \\

\word{Death} looms like a leering figure. \\
Bring our species into sight. \\

Do it again cos we're mindless piss-ants. \\
Do it again cos we haven't learned sense. \\
Do it again so we auto-cremate. \\
Don't do it again because it isn't safe. \\

Would you throw your deduction to the hungry wolf of fate? \\
Fill his plate with your namesake. \\
Fatten him with your ego. \\

Do it again cos we're mindless piss-ants. \\
Do it again cos we haven't learned sense. \\
Do it again so we auto-cremate. \\
Don't do it again because it isn't safe. \\
